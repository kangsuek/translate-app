1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,530
- So Rome always wins

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,328
because even if they lose battles,

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,519
they go to the Italian allies and half citizens

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,989
and raise new armies.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,550
So how do you beat them?

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,460
He can never raise that many troops himself.

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,879
And Hannibal, I think, correctly figures out

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,040
the one way to maybe defeat Rome

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,079
is to cut them away from their allies.

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,609
Well, how do you do this?

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:21,808
Hannibal's plan is,

12
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,878
I'm not gonna wait and fight the Romans

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,709
in Spain or North Africa.

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,080
I'm gonna invade Italy.

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,789
So I'm gonna strike at the heart

16
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,818
of this growing Roman Empire,

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,550
and my hope is that if I can win

18
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:38,819
a couple big battles against Rome in Italy,

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,790
the Italians will want their freedom back,

20
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,409
and they'll rebel from Rome

21
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,328
and maybe even join me.

22
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,099
Because most people who have been conquered

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,210
want their freedom back,

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,359
so this is a reasonable plan.

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,749
So Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants.

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,680
Dramatic stuff.

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,058
Nobody expects them to do this.

28
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,830
Nobody thinks you can do this.

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,508
Shows up in northern Italy,

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:01,738
Romans send an army,

31
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,090
Hannibal massacres them.

32
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,860
He is a military genius.

33
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,359
Rome takes a year,

34
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,729
raises a second army, we know this story,

35
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,959
sends it against Hannibal,

36
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,162
Hannibal wipes 'em out.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,417
Rome gets clever this time.

38
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,150
They say, "Okay, Hannibal's different.

39
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,980
We're gonna take two years,

40
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,300
raise two armies,

41
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,749
and send them both out at the same time against Hannibal."

42
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,723
So they do this,

43
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:24,089
and this is the Battle of Cannae,

44
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,480
which is one of the most famous battles in history.

45
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,190
Hannibal is facing this army of 80,000 Romans about,

46
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,679
and he comes up with strategy called double envelopment.

47
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,150
I mean, we can go into it later if you want,

48
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,319
but it's this famous strategy

49
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,448
where he basically kind of sucks the Romans in,

50
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,400
surrounds them on all sides,

51
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,230
and in one afternoon,

52
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,760
at the Battle of Cannae,

53
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans.

54
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,889
Now, just to put that in perspective,

55
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,709
that's more Romans hacked to death

56
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,108
in one afternoon with swords

57
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,201
than Americans died in 20 years in Vietnam.

58
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,378
- The following is a conversation with Gregory Aldrete,

59
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,738
a historian specializing in Ancient Rome

60
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,530
and military history.

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,419

64
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,902
And now, dear friends, here's Gregory Aldrete.

65
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,629
What do you think is the big difference

66
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,229
between the ancient world and the modern world?

67
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,819
- Well, the easy answer,

68
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,428
the one you often get is technology.

69
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,070
And obviously, there's huge differences in technology

70
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,508
between the ancient world and today.

71
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,428
But I think some of the more interesting stuff

72
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,590
is a little bit more amorphous things,

73
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,940
more structural things.

74
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:43,709
So I would say,

75
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,813
first of all, childhood mortality.

76
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,700
In the ancient world,

77
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,529
and this is true of Greeks, Romans, Egyptians,

78
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,470
really anybody up until about the Industrial Revolution,

79
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:57,388
about 30 to 40% of kids died before they hit puberty.

80
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:58,859
So I mean, put yourself in the place

81
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,049
of an average inhabitant of the ancient world.

82
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,179
If you were an ancient person,

83
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,670
three or four of your kids probably would've died.

84
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,048
You would've buried your children.

85
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,239
And nowadays, we think of that as an unusual thing.

86
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,820
And just psychologically, that's a huge thing.

87
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,282
You would've seen multiple of your siblings die.

88
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,650
If you were a woman, for example,

89
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,750
if you were lucky enough to make it to,

90
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,639
let's say, age 13,

91
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,528
you probably would have to give birth four or five times

92
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,039
in order just to keep the population from dying out.

93
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,999
So those kind of grim mortality statistics,

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,220
I think, are a huge difference, psychologically,

95
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,138
between the ancient world and the modern.

96
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,859
- But fundamentally, do you think human nature changed much?

97
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,619
Do you think the same elements of what we see today,

98
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,189
fear, greed, love, hope,

99
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,318
optimism, and the cynicism,

100
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,218
you know, the underlying forces that result in war,

101
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,072
all of that permeates human history?

102
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,379
- Crude answer, yes.

103
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,888
I think human nature is roughly constant.

104
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,438
And for me, as an ancient historian,

105
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,258
the kind of documents that I really like dealing with

106
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,859
are not the traditional literary sources,

107
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,409
but they're the things that give us those little glimpse

108
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:14,848
into everyday life.

109
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:17,969
So stuff like tombstones or graffiti,

110
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,630
or just something that survives on a scrap of parchment

111
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,448
that records a financial transaction.

112
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,279
And whenever I read some of those,

113
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,916
I'll have this moment of, you know, feeling,

114
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,158
"Oh, I know exactly how that person felt."

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,439
Here across 2000 years of time,

116
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,999
completely different cultures,

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,870
I have this spark of sympathy with someone from antiquity.

118
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,370
And I think, as a historian,

119
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,590
the way you begin to understand

120
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,478
an alien, a foreign culture,

121
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,129
which is what these cultures are,

122
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,619
is to look for those little moments of sympathy.

123
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,910
But on the other hand,

124
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,220
there's ways in which ancient cultures

125
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,679
are wildly different from us.

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,176
So you also look for those moments where you just think,

127
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:00,269
"How the hell could these people have done that?

128
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:01,859
I just don't understand

129
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,440
how they could have thought or acted in this way."

130
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,499
And it's lining up those moments of sympathy

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,569
and kind of disconnection

132
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,359
that I think is when you begin to start to understand

133
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,880
a foreign culture or an ancient culture.

134
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,888
- I love the idea of assembling the big picture

135
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,719
from the details and the little pieces,

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,970
because that is the thing that makes up life.

137
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,039
The big picture is nothing without the details.

138
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,390
- Yep, yep, and those details

139
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,919
would bring it to life, you know.

140
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,440
I mean, it's not the grand sweep of things.

141
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,499
It's seeing those little hopes and fears.

142
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,720
Another thing that I think is a huge difference

143
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,630
between the modern world and the ancient

144
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:39,959
is just, basically, everybody's a farmer.

145
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,878
Everybody's a small family farmer.

146
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,989
And we forget this. - Yeah.

147
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,730
- I was just writing a lecture

148
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,100
for my next Great Courses course,

149
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,530
and I was writing about farming in the ancient world.

150
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,089
And I was really thinking,

151
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,939
if we were to write a realistic textbook

152
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,068
of, let's say, the Roman Empire,

153
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,629
9 out of 10 chapter

154
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,159
should be details of what it was like

155
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,049
to be a small-time family farmer,

156
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,659
because that's what 90% of the people

157
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,460
in the ancient world did.

158
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,259
They weren't soldiers, they weren't priests,

159
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,029
they weren't kings, they weren't authors,

160
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,619
they weren't artists,

161
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,050
they were small town family farmers.

162
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,150
And they lived in a little village,

163
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,818
they never traveled 20 miles from that village,

164
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:18,809
they were born there,

165
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,100
they married somebody from there,

166
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,1000
they raised kids,

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,370
they mucked around in the dirt for a couple decades,

168
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,720
and they died.

169
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
They never saw a battle,

170
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,269
they never saw a work of art,

171
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:28,918
they never saw a philosopher,

172
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,989
they never took part in any of the things

173
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,183
we define as being history.

174
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,149
So that's what life should be,

175
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,348
and that's representative.

176
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,220
- Nevertheless,

177
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,320
it is the emperors and the philosophers

178
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,149
and the artists and the warriors

179
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,229
who carve history.

180
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,429
- And it is the important stuff.

181
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,530
So, I mean, you know, that's true.

182
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,208
There's a reason we focus on that.

183
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,289
- That's a good reminder though.

184
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,760
If we want to truly empathize

185
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,339
and understand what life was like,

186
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,279
we have to represent it fully.

187
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,379
- And I would say, let's not forget them.

188
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,599
So let's not forget what life was like

189
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,090
for 80, 90% of the people in the ancient world,

190
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,649
the ones we don't talk about,

191
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,838
because that's important too.

192
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,529
- So the Roman Empire is widely considered

193
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,569
to be the most powerful, influential,

194
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,439
and impactful empire in human history.

195
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,689
What are some reasons for that?

196
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,599
- Yeah, I mean, Rome is,

197
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,240
has been hugely influential, I think,

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,369
just because of the image.

199
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,170
I mean, there's all these practical ways.

200
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,350
I mean, the words I'm using to speak with you today,

201
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,789
30% are direct from Latin,

202
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,359
another 30% are from Latin descended languages.

203
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,589
Our law codes,

204
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,079
I mean, our habits, our holidays,

205
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,349
everything comes fairly directly from the ancient world.

206
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,150
But the image of Rome,

207
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,158
at least, again, in Western civilization,

208
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,853
has really been the dominant image of a successful empire.

209
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,019
And I think that's what gives it a lot of its fascination.

210
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,119
This idea that, "Oh, it was this great,

211
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,579
powerful, culturally influential empire."

212
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,199
And there's a lot of 'em, other empires.

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,569
I mean, we could talk about Ancient China,

214
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,118
which, arguably, was just as big as Rome,

215
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,559
just as culturally sophisticated,

216
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,870
lasted about the same amount of time.

217
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,939
But, at least in Western civilization,

218
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,979
Rome is the paradigm.

219
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,720
But Rome is a little schizophrenic

220
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,090
in that it's both the empire

221
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,559
when it was ruled by emperors,

222
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,997
which is one kind of model,

223
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:23,340
and it's the Roman Republic

224
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,859
when it was a pseudo democracy,

225
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,480
which is a different model.

226
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,170
And it's interesting how some later civilizations

227
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,900
tend to either focus on one or the other of those.

228
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,669
So, you know, the United States,

229
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,749
revolutionary France,

230
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,020
they were very obsessed with the Roman Republic as a model.

231
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,859
But other people,

232
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,139
Mussolini, Hitler, Napoleon,

233
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,119
they were very obsessed with the empire,

234
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,970
Victorian Britain, as a model.

235
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,479
So Rome itself has different aspects,

236
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,129
but what I think is actually another big difference

237
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,468
between the modern world and the ancient

238
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,470
is our relationship with the past.

239
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,420
So one of the keys to understanding all of Roman history

240
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,189
is to understand that this was a people

241
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,199
who were obsessed with the past

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,950
and for whom the past had power,

243
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,139
not just as something inspirational,

244
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,969
but it actually dictated

245
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,220
what you would do in your daily life.

246
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,979
And today, especially in the United States,

247
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,680
we don't have much of a relationship with the past.

248
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,598
We see ourselves as free agents,

249
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,829
just floating along,

250
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,229
not tethered to what came before.

251
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,700
And the classical story

252
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,290
that I sometimes tell in my classes

253
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,379
to illustrate this is

254
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,998
Rome started out as a monarchy.

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,199
They had kings,

256
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,089
they were kind of unhappy with their kings,

257
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,489
around 500 BC,

258
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,719
they held a revolution

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,190
and they kicked out the kings.

260
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,050
And one of the guys who played a key role in this

261
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:48,632
was a man named Lucius Junius Brutus, okay.

262
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,745
500 years later,

263
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:54,989
500 years down the road,

264
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,879
a guy comes along, Julius Caesar,

265
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,609
who starts to act like a king.

266
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,850
So if you have trouble with kings in Roman society,

267
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,229
who are you gonna call?

268
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,030
Somebody named Brutus.

269
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:07,049
Now, as it happens,

270
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,019
there is a guy named Brutus in Roman society at this time,

271
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,269
who's one of Julius Caesar's best friends,

272
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:14,548
Marcus Junius Brutus.

273
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,649
Now, before I go further with the story,

274
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,652
and I think you probably know where it ends,

275
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,379
I just talk about how important your ancestors are

276
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:23,608
in Roman culture.

277
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,489
I mean, if you went to an aristocrat Roman's house

278
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,350
and opened the front door and walked in,

279
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,290
the first thing you would see would be a big wooden cabinet.

280
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:32,728
And if you open that up,

281
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,910
what you would see would be row after row

282
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,879
of wax death masks.

283
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,379
So when a Roman aristocrat died,

284
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,298
they literally put hot wax on his face

285
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,578
and made an impression of his face at that moment.

286
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,469
And they hung these in a big cabinet

287
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,090
right inside the front door.

288
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,739
So every time you entered your house,

289
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,010
you were literally staring at the faces of your ancestors.

290
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,979
And every child in that family

291
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,799
would have obsessively memorized

292
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,069
every accomplishment of every one of those ancestors.

293
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,540
He would've known their career,

294
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,469
what offices they held,

295
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,520
what battles they fought in,

296
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,139
what they did.

297
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,208
When somebody new in the family died,

298
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,379
there would be a big funeral,

299
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,459
and they would talk about

300
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,739
all the things their ancestors had did.

301
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,800
The kids in the family would literally take out those masks,

302
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,599
tie them onto their own faces,

303
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,760
and wear them in the funeral possession.

304
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,149
So you were like wearing the face of your ancestors.

305
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,189
So you, as an individual, weren't important.

306
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,549
You were just the latest iteration of that family.

307
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:32,459
And there was enormous weight, huge weight,

308
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,489
to live up to the deeds of your ancestors.

309
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,889
So the Romans were absolutely obsessed with the past,

310
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,778
especially with your own family.

311
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,158
Every Roman kid, who is,

312
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,358
let's say, in aristocrat family,

313
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,569
could tell you every one of his ancestors backed centuries.

314
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,100
I can't go beyond my grandparents,

315
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,933
I don't even know,

316
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,559
but that's, you know, maybe a hundred years.

317
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,168
So it's a completely different attitude towards the past.

318
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,429
- And the level of celebration

319
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,229
that we have now of the ancestors,

320
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,250
even the ones we can name,

321
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,075
is not as intense as it was in the Roman times.

322
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:58,908
- No, no, I mean,

323
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:01,620
it was obsessive and oppressive.

324
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,660
It determined what you did. - Oppressive. Oh.

325
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,429
- Yes. Because there's that weight

326
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,919
for you to act like your ancestors did.

327
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,378
- Do you think, not to speak sort of philosophically,

328
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,778
but do you think it was limiting

329
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,939
to the way the society develops to be-

330
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,839
- Yes, absolutely. - deeply constrained by the,

331
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,210
limiting in a good way or a bad way, you think?

332
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,320
- Well, you know, like everything,

333
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,180
it's a little of both, but the bad...

334
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:26,009
So on the one hand, it gives them enormous strength.

335
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,629
And it gives them this enormous connection,

336
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:28,529
it gives them guidance.

337
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,448
But the negatives, what's interesting,

338
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,900
is it makes the Romans extremely traditional-minded

339
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,818
and extremely conservative.

340
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,959
And I mean conservative in the sense of resistant to change.

341
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,460
So in the late Republic,

342
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,839
which we'll probably talk about later,

343
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,690
Rome desperately needed to change certain things,

344
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,180
but it was a society that did things

345
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,739
the way the ancestors did it,

346
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,170
and they didn't make some obvious changes,

347
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,389
which might have saved the republic.

348
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,679
So that's the downside

349
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,239
is that it locks you into something

350
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,860
and you can't change.

351
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,080
But to get us back to the Brutuses,

352
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,010
so 500 years after that first Brutus got rid of kings,

353
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,629
Julius Caesar starts to act like a king,

354
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:09,359
one of his best friends is Marcus Junius Brutus,

355
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,130
and literally, in the middle of the night,

356
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,749
people go to Brutus' house

357
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,067
and write graffiti on it that says,

358
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,300
"Remember your ancestor."

359
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,078
And another one is, I think, "You are no real Brutus."

360
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,400
And at that point,

361
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,899
he really has no choice.

362
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,429
He forms a conspiracy,

363
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,589
and on the Ides of March, 44 BC,

364
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,230
he and 23 other senators take daggers,

365
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,520
stick them in Julius Caesar,

366
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,739
and kill him for acting like a king.

367
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,139
So the way I always pose this to my students is,

368
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,300
how many of you would stick a knife in your best friend

369
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,609
because of what your great, great, great, great,

370
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,259
great, great, great, great, great, great, great,

371
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,899
great grandfather did?

372
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,189
- That's commitment.

373
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,259
- That's the power of the past.

374
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,739
That's a society where the past isn't just influential,

375
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,659
but it dictates what you do.

376
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:01,259
And that concept, I think, is very alien to us today.

377
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,448
We can't imagine murdering our best friend

378
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,027
because of what some incredibly distant ancestor did

379
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,349
500 years ago.

380
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,019
But to Brutus, there is no choice.

381
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,668
You have to do that.

382
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,968
And a lot of societies have this power of the past.

383
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,530
Today, not so much, but some still do.

384
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,368
About a decade ago, I was in Serbia,

385
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,259
and I was talking to some of the people there

386
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,268
about the breakup of Yugoslavia

387
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,948
and some of the wars that had taken place

388
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,810
where people turned against their neighbors,

389
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,978
basically murdered people

390
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,290
they had lived next to for decades.

391
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,609
And when I was talking to them,

392
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,137
some of them actually brought up things like,

393
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,658
"Oh, well, it was justified

394
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,179
because in this battle in 12 whatever,

395
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,285
they did this."

396
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,1000
And I was thinking, "Wow,

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,730
you're citing something from 800 years ago

398
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,069
to justify your actions today."

399
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,989
That's a modern person

400
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,389
who still understands the power of the past,

401
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,148
or maybe is, you know, crippled by it

402
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,739
is another way to view it.

403
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,749
- So this is an interesting point

404
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,340
and an interesting perspective to remember

405
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,810
about the way the Romans thought,

406
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,039
especially in the context of how power is transferred,

407
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,349
whether it's hereditary or not,

408
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,720
which changes throughout Roman history.

409
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,553
So it's interesting.

410
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:11,909
It's interesting to remember that,

411
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,219
the value of the ancestors. - Yep.

412
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,930
And just the weight of tradition.

413
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:16,762
- The weight of tradition.

414
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:18,110
- The Romans, the mos maiorum

415
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,593
is this Latin term which means

416
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:21,809
'the way the ancestors did it.'

417
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,938
And it's kind of their word for tradition.

418
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,540
So for them, tradition is what your forefathers

419
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,948
and mothers did.

420
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,510
And you have to follow that example

421
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:31,769
and you have to live up to that.

422
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,048
- Does that mean that class mobility was difficult?

423
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,539
So if your ancestors were farmers,

424
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,309
there was a major constraint

425
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:40,289
on remaining a farmer, essentially?

426
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:41,609
- I mean,

427
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,770
the Romans all like to think of themselves as farmers,

428
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,089
even filthy rich Romans.

429
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,009
It was just their national identity

430
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:49,408
is the citizen, soldier, farmer thing.

431
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:51,868
But it did, among the aristocrats,

432
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,613
the people who kind of ran things,

433
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,548
yeah, it was hard to break into that

434
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:59,069
if you didn't have famous ancestors.

435
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,390
And it was such a big deal

436
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,768
that there was a specific term

437
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:04,409
called a novus homo, a new man,

438
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:08,038
for someone who was the first person in their family

439
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,068
to get elected to a major office in the Roman government

440
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,630
because that was a weird

441
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,159
and different and new thing,

442
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,159
so you actually designated them by this special term.

443
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,959
So yeah, you're absolutely right.

444
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,390
- So if we may, let us zoom out.

445
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,129
It would help me, maybe it'll help the audience

446
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,239
to look at the different periods

447
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,369
that we've been talking about.

448
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,019
So you mentioned the republic.

449
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,745
You mentioned maybe when it took a form of empire

450
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:33,089
and maybe there was the age of kings.

451
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,090
What are the different periods of this Roman,

452
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,560
let's call it what the big...

453
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,869
- Roman history. Yep. - Roman history.

454
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,149
And a lot of people just call that whole period

455
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,158
Roman Empire loosely, right?

456
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,743
So maybe can you speak to the different periods firstly?

457
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:47,490
- Yes, absolutely. So conventionally,

458
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,360
Roman history is divided into three chronological periods.

459
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,880
The first of those is from 773 BC to 509 BC,

460
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,230
which is called the monarchy.

461
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,550
So all the periods get their names

462
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:01,019
from the form of government.

463
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,838
So this is the earliest phase of Roman history.

464
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,969
It's when Rome is mostly just

465
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,800
a fairly undistinguished

466
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,928
little collection of mud huts, honestly,

467
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,999
just like dozens of other cities

468
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,009
of little mud huts in Italy.

469
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,119
So that early phase,

470
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,719
about 750 to around 500 BC,

471
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,940
is the monarchy, they're ruled by kings.

472
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,440
Then there's this revolution,

473
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,460
they kick out the kings,

474
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,050
they become a republic.

475
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,098
That lasts from 500 BC roughly to,

476
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,949
eh, about either 31 or 27 BC,

477
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,839
depending on what date you pick is most important,

478
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,728
but about 500 years.

479
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,409
And the republic is when they have

480
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,780
a Republican form of government.

481
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,479
Some people idealize this as Rome's greatest period.

482
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,709
And the big thing in that period

483
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,149
is Rome first expands to conquer all of Italy

484
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,250
in the first 250 years of that 500 year stretch,

485
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,810
and then the second 250 years,

486
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,299
they conquer all the Mediterranean basin, roughly.

487
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,339
So this is this time of enormous

488
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,638
successful Roman conquest and expansion.

489
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,319
And then you have another switch up

490
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,319
and they become ruled by emperors.

491
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,988
So back to the idea of one guy in charge,

492
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,389
though the Romans try to pretend it's not like a king,

493
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,410
it's something else, and...

494
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,670
Anyway, we can get into that,

495
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,440
but they're very touchy about kings.

496
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,560
So they have emperors, Roman empire.

497
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,108
The first emperor is Augustus.

498
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:20,548
Starts off as Octavian,

499
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,459
switches the name to Augustus when he becomes emperor.

500
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,069
He kind of sets the model for what happens.

501
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:29,339
And then how long does the Roman Empire last?

502
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,859
That's one of those great questions.

503
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,209
The conventional answer

504
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,580
is usually sometime in the 5th century,

505
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:37,319
so the 400s AD.

506
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,629
So about another 500 years, let's say.

507
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,490
So nice kind of even division.

508
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,280
500 years of republic, 500 years of empire.

509
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,848
But you can make very good cases for lots of other dates

510
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,038
for the end of the Roman Empire.

511
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,396
I actually think it goes all the way

512
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,879
through the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453,

513
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,009
so another 1500 years.

514
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,658
But that's a whole another discussion.

515
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,307
But, so that's your three phases of Roman history.

516
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,099
- And in some fundamental way,

517
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,969
it still persists today

518
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,210
given how much of its ideas

519
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,349
define our modern life,

520
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:08,879
especially in the Western world.

521
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,713
- Yeah.

522
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,569
- Can you speak to the relationship

523
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,928
between Ancient Greece and Roman Empire,

524
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,550
both in the chronological sense

525
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:19,859
and in the influence sense?

526
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,099
- Well, I mean, Ancient Greece comes,

527
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,739
the classical era of Greek civilization

528
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,920
is around the 500s BC.

529
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,799
That's when you have the great achievements of Athens.

530
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,589
It becomes the first sort of true democracy.

531
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,478
They defeat the Persian invasions.

532
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,100
A lot of the famous stuff happens

533
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:41,219
around in the 400s, let's say.

534
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,519
So that is contemporaneous with Rome,

535
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,431
but the Greek civilization sense is peaking earlier.

536
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,429
And one of the things that happens is that

537
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,769
Greece ends up being conquered by Rome

538
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:55,079
in that second half of the Roman Republic,

539
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:57,898
between 250 and about 30 BC.

540
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,259
And so Greece falls under the control of Rome

541
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,759
and Rome is very heavily influenced by Greek culture.

542
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,239
They themselves see the Greeks as a superior civilization,

543
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,889
culturally more sophisticated,

544
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,289
great art, great philosophy, all this.

545
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:14,999
And another thing about the Romans

546
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,640
is they're super competitive.

547
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,750
So one of the things that,

548
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,259
one of the engines that drives Romans

549
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:24,479
is this public competitiveness,

550
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,029
especially among the upper classes.

551
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:29,368
They care more about their status

552
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,288
and standing among their peers

553
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,139
than they do about money or even their own life.

554
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,059
So there's this intense competition.

555
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,219
And when they conquer Greece,

556
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,389
Greek culture just becomes one more arena of competition.

557
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,700
So Romans will start to learn Greek,

558
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,650
they'll start to memorize Homer,

559
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,590
they'll start to see who can quote more passages of Homer

560
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,389
in Greek, in their letters to one another

561
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,789
because that increases their status.

562
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,668
So Rome kind of absorbs Greek civilization,

563
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,339
and then the two get fused together.

564
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,289
The other thing I should mention in terms of influences

565
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:04,199
that's really huge on Rome is the Etruscan.

566
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,599
And this is one that comes along before the Greeks.

567
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,788
So the Etruscans were this,

568
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:11,128
eh, kind of mysterious culture

569
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,809
that flourished in northern Italy

570
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:16,142
before the Romans, so way back 800 BC.

571
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,120
They were much more powerful than the Romans.

572
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,639
They were kind a loose confederation of states.

573
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,809
For awhile, the Romans even seemed

574
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,759
to have been under Etruscan control,

575
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,529
the last of the Roman kings

576
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,691
was really an Etruscan guy, pretty clearly.

577
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,789
But the Etruscans end up giving to Rome,

578
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:34,918
or you could say Romans up stealing

579
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,089
perhaps a lot of elements of Etruscan culture.

580
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,978
And many of the things that we today

581
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,350
think of as distinctively Roman,

582
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:46,168
that, you know, it was our cliches of what a Roman is

583
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,940
actually aren't truly Roman.

584
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,100
They're stuff they stole from the Etruscans.

585
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,529
So just a couple examples, the toga?

586
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:53,549
What do you think of a Roman?

587
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,748
It's a guy wearing a toga,

588
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,550
and the toga's the mark of Roman citizen.

589
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,368
Well, that's what Etruscan kings wore, probably.

590
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:00,568
Gladiator games,

591
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,328
we associate those very intensely with the Romans.

592
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:05,728
Well, they probably stole that from the Etruscans.

593
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,799
A lot of Roman religion.

594
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,749
Jupiter is a thunder God,

595
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,159
all sorts of divination.

596
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,499
The Romans love to, you know, chop open animals

597
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,290
and look at their livers and predict the future.

598
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:18,269
That comes from the Etruscans.

599
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:21,028
Watching the flight of birds to predict the future.

600
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,739
That comes from the Etruscans.

601
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,320
So there's a lot of central elements

602
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,508
of what we think of is Roman civilization,

603
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:30,209
which actually are borrowings, let's say,

604
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,060
from the these older, slightly mysterious Etruscans.

605
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,369
- I mean, that's a really powerful thing

606
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,319
as a powerful aspect of a civilization

607
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,208
to be able to, we can call it stealing,

608
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,950
which is a negative connotation,

609
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,349
but you can also see its integration, basically.

610
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:48,059
Yes, steal the best stuff from the peoples you conquer

611
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,039
or the people's that you interact with.

612
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,559
Not every empire does that.

613
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,559
There's a lot of nations and empires that when they conquer,

614
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,790
they annihilate versus integrate.

615
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:06,298
And so it's an interesting thing to be able to, culturally.

616
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,868
Like the form that the competitiveness takes

617
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:13,619
is that you want to compete in the realm of ideas in culture

618
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:18,619
versus compete strictly in the realm of military conquest.

619
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,718
- Yeah, and I think you've exactly put your finger

620
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,349
on one of the, let's say, secrets of Rome's success,

621
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,849
which is that they're very good at integrating non-Romans

622
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,498
or non-Roman ideas

623
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,389
and kind of absorbing them.

624
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,419
So one of the things that's absolutely crucial

625
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,750
early in Roman history

626
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:41,909
when they're just one of these tiny little mud hut villages

627
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,160
fighting dozens of other mud hut villages in Italy,

628
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,499
why does Rome emerge as the dominant one?

629
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,970
Well, one of the things they do

630
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,150
is when they do finally succeed in conquering somebody else,

631
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,940
let's say another Italianate people,

632
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,379
they do something very unusual.

633
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,210
Because the normal procedure in the ancient world

634
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,140
is you conquer some,

635
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,819
let's say you conquer another city,

636
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,008
you often kill most of the men

637
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,269
and slave the women and children,

638
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,219
steal all the stuff, right?

639
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,679
The Romans, at least with the Italians,

640
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,940
conquer the other city,

641
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,169
and sometimes they'll do that,

642
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,797
but sometimes they'll also then say,

643
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:14,130
"All right, we're gonna now leave you alone

644
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,290
and we're going to share with you

645
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,838
a degree of Roman citizenship."

646
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,579
Sometimes that make them full citizens,

647
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,369
more often that make them something we call half citizens,

648
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:24,905
which is kind of what sounds like

649
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:26,429
you get some of the privileges of citizenship,

650
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,390
but not all of them.

651
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,399
Sometimes they would just make them allies,

652
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,930
but they would sort of incorporate them

653
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,300
into the Roman project.

654
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,328
And they wouldn't necessarily ask for money or taxes,

655
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,738
which is weird too,

656
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,299
but instead, the one thing they would always, always demand

657
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,821
from the conquered cities in Italy

658
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:46,923
is that they provide troops to the Roman army.

659
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,778
So the army becomes this mechanism of Romanization

660
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,759
where you pull in foreigners,

661
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,319
you make them like you,

662
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,019
and then they end up fighting for you.

663
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:01,648
And early on, the secret to Rome's military success

664
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,480
is not that they have better generals,

665
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,800
it's not that they have better equipment,

666
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,138
it's not that they have better strategy or tactics,

667
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,340
it's that they have limitless manpower, relatively speaking.

668
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:12,929
So they lose a war,

669
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,460
and they just come back and fight again.

670
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,659
And they lose again,

671
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,610
and they come back and they fight again.

672
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:20,249
And eventually, they just wear down their enemies

673
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,410
because their key thing of their policy

674
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,110
is we incorporate the conquered people.

675
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,479
And the great moment that just exemplifies this

676
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,159
is pretty late in this process.

677
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,829
So they've been doing this for 250 years, just about.

678
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:33,929
And they've gotten down to the toe of Italy,

679
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,110
they're conquering the very last cities down there.

680
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:39,028
And one of the last cities is actually a Greek city;

681
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,438
it's a Greek colony.

682
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,460
It's a wealthy city,

683
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,410
and so when the Romans show up on the doorstep

684
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,150
and are about to attack them,

685
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,730
they do what any rich Greek colony or city does.

686
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,220
They go out and hire the best mercenaries they can.

687
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,260
And they hire this guy who thinks of himself

688
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,388
as the new Alexander the Great,

689
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,350
a man named Pyrrhus of Epirus.

690
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,699
So he is a mercenary,

691
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,880
he is actually related to Alexander, distantly.

692
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,429
He has a terrific army, top-notch army.

693
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,960
He's got elephants,

694
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,690
you know, he's got all the latest military technology.

695
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,819
The Romans come and fight a battle against him,

696
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,258
and Pyrrhus knows what he's doing.

697
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:12,388
He wipes out the Romans.

698
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,789
He thinks, "Okay, now we'll have a peace treaty,

699
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,139
we'll negotiate something,

700
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,430
I can go home."

701
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,439
But the Romans won't even talk.

702
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,410
They go to their Italian allies and half citizens,

703
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,670
they raise a second army,

704
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,496
they send them against Pyrrhus.

705
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,329
Pyrrhus says, "Okay,

706
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:28,589
these guys are slow learners. Fine."

707
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,988
He fights them again, wipes them out.

708
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,269
Thinks now we'll have a peace treaty.

709
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:35,188
But the Romans go back to the allies,

710
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,210
raise a third army,

711
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,279
and send it after Pyrrhus.

712
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,405
And when he sees that third army coming, he says,

713
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:44,878
"I can't afford to win another battle.

714
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,960
I win these battles,

715
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,210
but each time, I lose some of my troops

716
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,680
and I can't replace them.

717
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,010
And the Romans just keeps sprouting new armies."

718
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:54,928
So he gives up and goes home.

719
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,660
So Rome kind of loses every battle,

720
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,280
but wins the war.

721
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,408
And Pyrrhus, one of his,

722
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,120
actually, his officers has a great line

723
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,439
as they're kind of going back to Greece.

724
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,819
He says, "Fighting the Romans is like fighting a hydra."

725
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:11,459
And a hydra is this mythological monster

726
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,349
that when you cut off one head,

727
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:15,418
two more grow in its place.

728
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,029
So you can just never win. - That's fascinating.

729
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,412
- So that's the secret to Rome's early success.

730
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:22,590
- That's not the military strategy.

731
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:26,368
It's not some technological asymmetry of power.

732
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:28,288
It's literally just manpower.

733
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,296
- Uh-huh. Early on. - Early on.

734
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:33,150
- And later, the Romans get very good when,

735
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,650
we're into the empire phase now,

736
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,380
so once they have emperors into the AD era,

737
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,190
of kind of doing the same thing

738
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,869
by drawing in the best and the brightest

739
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:47,008
and the most ambitious

740
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:50,489
and the most talented local leaders

741
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,719
of the people they conquer.

742
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,460
So when they go someplace,

743
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,430
let say they conquer tribe of what to them as barbarians,

744
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,490
they'll often take the sons of the barbarian chiefs,

745
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,510
bring them to Rome,

746
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:02,549
and raise them as Romans. - Damn.

747
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:04,079
- And so it's that whole way

748
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,529
of kind of turning your enemies into your own strength.

749
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:10,979
And the Romans start giving citizenship

750
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,090
to areas they conquer.

751
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,649
So once they move out of Italy,

752
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,329
they aren't as free with the citizenship,

753
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,558
but eventually they do.

754
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,061
So they make Spain,

755
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,800
lost cities in Spain,

756
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:20,819
they make all citizens,

757
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:21,958
and other places.

758
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,633
And soon enough, the Roman emperors

759
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:27,120
and the Roman senators are not Italians.

760
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,668
They're coming from Spain or North Africa

761
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,679
or Germany or wherever.

762
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,490
So, you know, as early as the second century AD

763
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,119
of the Roman Empire,

764
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,768
so the first set of emperors,

765
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:39,958
the first hundred years were all Italians.

766
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,330
But right away, at the beginning of the second century AD,

767
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,398
you have Trajan, who's from Spain,

768
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,140
and the next guy, Hadrian, is from Spain.

769
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,120
And then a century later, you have Septimius Severus,

770
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,188
who's from North Africa.

771
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,020
You would later get guys from Syria.

772
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:54,659
So I mean, the actual leaders of the Roman Empire

773
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,700
are coming from the provinces.

774
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,410
- That's brilliant. - And it's that openness

775
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,840
to incorporating foreigners,

776
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,978
making them work for you,

777
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,980
making them want to be part of your empire

778
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,290
that I think is one of the Rome strengths.

779
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,929
- Yeah, taking the sons is a brilliant idea,

780
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,627
and bringing them to Rome,

781
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:15,029
'cause it's a kind of a generational integration.

782
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:17,729
- And the Roman military later in the empire

783
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,989
is this giant machine of half a million people

784
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,380
that takes in foreigners and churns out Romans.

785
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,630
So the army is composed of two groups.

786
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,480
You have the Roman Legionaries, who are all citizens,

787
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,359
but then you have another group that's just as large,

788
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,121
about 250,000 of each,

789
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:36,330
250,000 legionaries,

790
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:40,079
250,000 of the second group called auxiliaries.

791
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,248
And auxiliaries tend to be newly conquered, war-like people

792
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,190
that the Romans enlist as auxiliaries

793
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,660
to fight with them.

794
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,930
And they serve side by side with the Roman legions

795
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,240
for 25 years.

796
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,409
And at the end of that time,

797
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,720
when they're discharged, what do they get?

798
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,090
They get Roman citizenship.

799
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:04,228
And their kids then tend to become Roman legionaries.

800
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,480
So again, you're taking the most war-like

801
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,089
and potentially dangerous of your enemies,

802
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:10,318
kind of absorbing them,

803
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,029
putting through this thing for 25 years

804
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:13,019
where they learn Latin,

805
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,789
they learn Roman customs,

806
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:17,429
they maybe marry someone who's already a Roman

807
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,290
or a Latin woman,

808
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,728
they have kids within the system,

809
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,859
their kids become Roman legionaries,

810
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:24,839
and you've thoroughly integrated

811
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,059
what could have been your biggest enemies,

812
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,829
right, your greatest threat.

813
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,028
- That's just brilliant.

814
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,218
Brilliant process of integration.

815
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,470
Is that what explains the rapid expansion

816
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,659
during the late Republic?

817
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,660
- No. So there, it's more the indigenous Italians

818
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,170
who are in the army at that point.

819
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,179
They haven't really expanded the auxiliaries yet.

820
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,550
That's more something that happens in the empire.

821
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:49,379
So, yeah, so back it up,

822
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,729
so we have that first 250 years of the Roman Republic.

823
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,970
So from about 500 to, let's say, 250 BC.

824
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,199
And in that period,

825
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,510
they gradually expand throughout Italy,

826
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,009
conquer the other Italian cities,

827
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,959
who are pretty much like them.

828
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,509
So they're people who already speak similar languages

829
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:08,249
or the same language, have the same gods.

830
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,689
It's easy to integrate them.

831
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,020
That's the ones they make the half citizens and allies.

832
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:14,698
Then in the second half of that period,

833
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,519
from about 250 to, let's say, 30 BC,

834
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,039
Rome goes outside of Italy.

835
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,238
And this is a new world

836
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,950
because now they're encountering people

837
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,559
who are really fundamentally different.

838
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,149
So true others.

839
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,829
They do not have the same gods.

840
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,238
They don't speak the same language.

841
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,070
They have fundamentally different systems

842
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:33,899
of economy, everything.

843
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,130
And Rome first expands in the Western Mediterranean.

844
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,130
And there, their big rival is the city state of Carthage,

845
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:49,339
which is another city founded almost the same time as Rome

846
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,679
that has also been a young, vigorously expanding,

847
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,1000
aggressive empire.

848
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,770
So in the Western Empire at this time,

849
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:59,099
you have two sort of rival groups.

850
00:31:59,099 --> 00:31:59,969
And they're very different

851
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,900
because the Romans are these citizen, soldier, farmers.

852
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,060
So the Romans are all these small farmers.

853
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,039
That's the basis of their economy.

854
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,248
And it's the Romans who serve in the army.

855
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,730
So the person who is a citizen is also,

856
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,830
really, by main profession, a farmer,

857
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:19,259
and then in times of war, he becomes a soldier.

858
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,158
Carthage is an oligarchy of merchants.

859
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,349
So it's a very small citizen body.

860
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:27,869
They make their money through maritime trade.

861
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,779
So they have ships that go all over the Mediterranean.

862
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:33,928
They don't have a large army of Carthaginians;

863
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,229
instead, they hire mercenaries mostly to fight for them.

864
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,920
So it's almost these two rival systems.

865
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,630
You know, it's different philosophies,

866
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,060
different economies, everything.

867
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,728
Rome is strong on land, Carthage is strong at sea,

868
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,619
so there's this dichotomy.

869
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,508
But they're both looking to expand,

870
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:55,199
and they repeatedly come into conflict as they expand.

871
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,900
So Carthage is on the coast of north Africa,

872
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,279
Rome is in central Italy,

873
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,418
what's right between them?

874
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,920
The island of Sicily.

875
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,880
So the first big war is fought purely dictated by geography,

876
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,952
who gets Sicily, Rome or Carthage?

877
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,299
And Rome wins. In the end, they get it.

878
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,769
But Carthage is still strong,

879
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:14,602
they're not weakened.

880
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:16,530
So Carthage is now looking to expand.

881
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,269
The next place to go is Spain,

882
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:19,889
so they go and take Spain.

883
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,720
Rome, meanwhile, is moving along the coast

884
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,220
of what today is France.

885
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,330
Where are they gonna meet up?

886
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,279
On the border of Spain and France.

887
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,149
And there's a city at this point in time called Saguntum.

888
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,489
The second big war between Rome and Carthage

889
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,379
is over who gets Saguntum.

890
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,940
So I mean, you can just look at a map

891
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,680
and see this stuff coming.

892
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,289
Sometimes, geography is inevitability.

893
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:42,329
And I think, in the course of the wars

894
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:45,239
between Rome and Carthage called the Punic Wars,

895
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,940
there's this geographic inevitability to them.

896
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,829
- Can you speak to the Punic wars?

897
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,809
Why was,

898
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:54,029
there's so many levels on which we can talk about this,

899
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:56,609
but why was Rome victorious?

900
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,498
- Well, the Punic Wars, really,

901
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,750
almost always comes down to the Second Punic War.

902
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,310
There's three. There's three Punic wars.

903
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,899
The first is over Sicily. Rome wins.

904
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,719
The second is the big one.

905
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,070
And it's the big one

906
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,290
because Carthage, at this point in time,

907
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:11,339
just by sheer luck,

908
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,830
coughs up one of the greatest military geniuses

909
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:15,898
in all of history.

910
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,330
This guy, Hannibal Barca.

911
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:21,569
He was actually the son of the Carthaginian general

912
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,830
who fought Rome for Sicily.

913
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:23,968
Hamilcar was his father.

914
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,998
But Hannibal is this just genius,

915
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,790
just absolute military genius.

916
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:32,068
He goes to Spain,

917
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,889
he's the one who kind of organizes stuff there,

918
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,668
and now he knows the second war with Rome is inevitable.

919
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,190
And so the question is, how do you take down Rome?

920
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,023
He's smart.

921
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:43,260
He's seen Rome strength.

922
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,690
He knows it's the Italian allies.

923
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,280
So Rome always wins,

924
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,959
because even if they lose battles,

925
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,180
they go to the Italian allies and half citizens

926
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,649
and raise new armies.

927
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,180
So how do you beat them?

928
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,089
He can never raise that many troops himself.

929
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,509
And Hannibal, I think, correctly figures out

930
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,699
the one way to maybe defeat Rome

931
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:04,708
is to cut them away from their allies.

932
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,270
Well, how do you do this?

933
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:07,438
Hannibal's plan is,

934
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,509
I'm not gonna wait and fight the Romans

935
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,370
in Spain or North Africa.

936
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,708
I'm gonna invade Italy.

937
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,420
So I'm gonna strike at the heart

938
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,480
of this growing Roman Empire.

939
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,180
And my hope is that if I can win

940
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:24,449
a couple big battles against Rome in Italy,

941
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:27,449
the Italians will want their freedom back,

942
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,039
and they'll rebel from Rome

943
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,958
and maybe even join me.

944
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,730
Because most people who have been conquered

945
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,840
want their freedom back,

946
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,989
so this is a reasonable plan.

947
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:40,348
So Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants.

948
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:41,339
Dramatic stuff.

949
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,690
Nobody expects him to do this.

950
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,490
Nobody thinks you can do this.

951
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,138
Shows up in northern Italy,

952
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:47,399
Romans send an army,

953
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,720
Hannibal massacres them.

954
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,489
He is a military genius.

955
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:51,989
Rome takes a year,

956
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:54,388
raises a second army, we know this story,

957
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,588
sends it against Hannibal,

958
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,793
Hannibal wipes 'em out.

959
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,136
Rome gets clever this time.

960
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:00,749
They say, "Okay, Hannibal's different.

961
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,610
We're gonna take two years,

962
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,930
raise two armies,

963
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,379
and send them both out at the same time against Hannibal."

964
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,329
So they do this,

965
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:09,720
and this is the Battle of Cannae,

966
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:13,109
which is one of the most famous battles in history.

967
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:17,459
Hannibal is facing this army of 80,000 Romans about,

968
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,310
and he comes up with a strategy called Double Envelopment.

969
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:21,779
I mean, we can go into it later if you want,

970
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,949
but it's this famous strategy

971
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:25,078
where he basically kind of sucks the Romans in,

972
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,029
surrounds them on all sides,

973
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,389
and in one afternoon, at the Battle of Cannae,

974
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:35,389
Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans.

975
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,549
Now, just to put that in perspective,

976
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,340
that's more Romans hacked to death

977
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,739
in one afternoon with swords

978
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:47,399
than Americans died in 20 years in Vietnam.

979
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,230
I mean, you know, the Battle of Gettysburg,

980
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,459
which lasted three days

981
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,739
and was one of the bloodiest battles of civil war,

982
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:56,429
I think the actual deaths at that were maybe like 15,000.

983
00:36:56,429 --> 00:37:01,348
So this is a bloodshed of an almost unimaginable scale.

984
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,849
- That's also brutal.

985
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:04,288
- Yes, I mean, it's just- - Just a slaughter.

986
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,929
- mind boggling to think of that.

987
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:09,869
So now, this is Rome's darkest hour.

988
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:11,878
This is why the Second Punic War is important,

989
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,190
because there's that, you know, Nietzsche phrase,

990
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,290
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,

991
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:19,769
this is the closest Rome comes to death

992
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,599
in the history of the republic.

993
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,272
Hannibal almost kills Rome.

994
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,109
But no, it's not much of a spoiler.

995
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,339
Rome's gonna survive.

996
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,320
And from this point on, they're gonna be unbeatable.

997
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,079
But this is the crisis, this is the crucible.

998
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,779
This is the furnace that Rome passes through

999
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,159
that is the dividing point

1000
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,889
between when they're one more up and coming empire

1001
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:43,199
and when they're clearly the dominant power

1002
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,848
in the Mediterranean.

1003
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,009
So what do they do about Hannibal?

1004
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,750
Well, they're smart.

1005
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,070
We're not gonna fight him.

1006
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,540
We're not gonna give Hannibal

1007
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,579
the chance to kill more Romans.

1008
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,148
So they adopt a strategy that they'll follow Hannibal,

1009
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,500
or they raise a couple more armies,

1010
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,179
follow Hannibal around,

1011
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,549
but whenever Hannibal turns and tries to attack them,

1012
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,816
the Romans just back off.

1013
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:04,919
"No, thank you.

1014
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,199
We're not gonna let you, give you a chance."

1015
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,032
Meanwhile, though,

1016
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:10,379
they're not scared of other Carthaginians.

1017
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,090
So they raise a couple more armies

1018
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,520
and they send these to Spain, for example,

1019
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,938
and start attacking the Carthaginian holdings there.

1020
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,190
And by luck or necessity,

1021
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,230
Rome comes up with its own brilliant commander

1022
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,629
at this point, a guy named Scipio.

1023
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,839
And he wins victories in Spain, conquer Spain.

1024
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,029
Then he crosses into North Africa

1025
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,469
and starts to conquer that

1026
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:34,319
and ends up threatening Carthage directly.

1027
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,040
And poor Hannibal, undefeated in Italy,

1028
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:40,079
has now been walking up and down Italy,

1029
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,769
or marching up and down Italy for 12 years,

1030
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,509
looking for another fight.

1031
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,789
And the Romans won't give it to 'em.

1032
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:49,769
They've been attacking all these other areas

1033
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:52,048
and chipping away at Carthaginian power.

1034
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,050
So finally, after more than a decade in Italy,

1035
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,869
Hannibal is called back to defend the homeland,

1036
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,819
defend Carthage from Scipio.

1037
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,590
The two meet in a big battle.

1038
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,599
This should be one of the great battles of all times,

1039
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,469
the Battle of Zama,

1040
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,629
but, you know, Hannibal's guys

1041
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,400
are kind of old by this point.

1042
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,079
Scipio has all the advantages.

1043
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,851
He wins. Carthage is defeated.

1044
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,118
So that's pretty much the end of Carthage.

1045
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,288
The city survives,

1046
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,279
and then 50 years later,

1047
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,419
the Romans wipe it out,

1048
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,400
but that's not much of a war.

1049
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,200
But from this moment on,

1050
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,859
from the Second Punic War, which ends in 201 BC,

1051
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,970
Rome is, undisputably, the most powerful force,

1052
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:32,368
nation in the Mediterranean world.

1053
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,048
And having conquered the west,

1054
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,820
they're now gonna turn to the east,

1055
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,739
which is the Greek world.

1056
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,779
And the Greek world is older,

1057
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,979
it's richer,

1058
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,319
it's the rich part half of the Mediterranean,

1059
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,659
it's culturally more sophisticated.

1060
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,699
It's the world left by Alexander the Great,

1061
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,879
that's ruled by the descendants of his generals.

1062
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,520
And the Greeks kind of view themselves

1063
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,319
as superior to the Romans.

1064
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,547
I mean, to the Greeks,

1065
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,500
the Romans are these uncouth,

1066
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,689
sort of savage barbarians.

1067
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,369
But they're gonna get a real shock

1068
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:03,598
because the Roman army now

1069
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,998
has gotten really good to beat Hannibal.

1070
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,350
And when they go east,

1071
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:08,998
they're gonna just defeat the Greeks

1072
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,459
relatively easily, one after the other.

1073
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,819
And there's a famous historian named Polybius,

1074
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,840
who is a Greek,

1075
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,119
whose city was captured by the Romans,

1076
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,268
he later up becomes a friend to the Scipio family.

1077
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,579
He actually teaches some of the Scipio children

1078
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:24,988
about Greek culture.

1079
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,078
And he writes a history of Rome.

1080
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,498
And his motivation for writing this is, he says,

1081
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,766
at the beginning of this book, he says,

1082
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:36,599
"Surely, there can be no one so incurious

1083
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,268
as to not want to understand

1084
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:41,069
how the Romans could have conquered

1085
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,010
the entire Greek world in 53 years,"

1086
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,740
because that seems unimaginable to him.

1087
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,241
So he's writing this entire history

1088
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:50,459
as a way to try and understand

1089
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,960
how did the Romans do it.

1090
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,029
We were these wonderful, superior people,

1091
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,740
and they came around in 50 years,

1092
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:57,679
bang, that's the end of us.

1093
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,369
So that's his motivation.

1094
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:03,268
- Could you maybe speak to any interesting details

1095
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:07,019
of the military genius of Hannibal or Scipio at that time?

1096
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,248
What are some interesting aspects,

1097
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,799
this Double Envelopment idea?

1098
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,090
- I mean, Hannibal is good

1099
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,380
because he understood how to use different troop types

1100
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,730
and to play to their strengths

1101
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,440
and how to use terrain.

1102
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,839
So, I mean, this is basic military stuff,

1103
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,310
but he did it really well.

1104
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:26,159
So one of his victories against the Romans, for example,

1105
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,339
is when the Romans are marching along the edge of a lake

1106
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,369
and their army is strung out in marching formations.

1107
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,048
They're not kind of in combat formation,

1108
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,1000
but they're strung out along the edge of this lake.

1109
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,790
It's misty, there's not good visibility,

1110
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:41,068
and he ambushes them along this lakeside.

1111
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,273
So Lake Trasimene.

1112
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,149
And it's just using the terrain,

1113
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,983
understanding this,

1114
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,149
again, Hannibal's very much outnumbered,

1115
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,130
but he's able to use the terrain

1116
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,173
and to take the enemy by surprise.

1117
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:58,190
At Cannae, he's working against the expectations.

1118
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:00,658
So the traditional thing you do in the ancient world

1119
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,369
is the two armies would line up

1120
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,079
on opposite sides of a field,

1121
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,849
you'd put your best troops in the middle,

1122
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:07,619
you'd put your cavalry on the sides,

1123
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:10,228
you'd put your lightly armed skirmishers beyond those.

1124
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,629
And then the two sides kind of smack together.

1125
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,400
And the good troops fight the good troops

1126
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,960
and you see who wins.

1127
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,129
Now, Hannibal is hugely outnumbered

1128
00:42:19,128 --> 00:42:21,358
by this giant phalanx of heavy infantry,

1129
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,980
which is what the Romans specialized in.

1130
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,799
They're very good at sort of heavily armed foot soldiers.

1131
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,489
So he knows, "I don't want to go up against that.

1132
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:30,630
I don't have that many of that troop type.

1133
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,299
My guys aren't as good as the Romans anyway."

1134
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,800
So he lines up some of his less good troops in the center

1135
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,050
against the big, menacing Roman phalanx.

1136
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,409
And he tells them, "Okay, when the Romans come,

1137
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:45,269
you're not really trying to win.

1138
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:46,349
Just hold them up.

1139
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:47,548
Just delay them."

1140
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,829
And even tells them, "You can give ground."

1141
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:51,208
So you can retreat

1142
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,530
and sort of let the line

1143
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,230
form a big kind of C-shaped crescent.

1144
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,210
Let the Romans sort of advance into you,

1145
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,800
but just hold that line.

1146
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,600
And meanwhile, he puts his cavalry

1147
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,248
and his good troops on the side.

1148
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,570
And so on the sides,

1149
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,759
those good troops defeat the Romans,

1150
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,039
and then they kind of circle in behind the Romans

1151
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:10,588
and attack that big, menacing Roman phalanx

1152
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,779
from the rear where it's very vulnerable.

1153
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,570
And so Hannibal catches the Romans

1154
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,029
in this sort of giant cauldron

1155
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,329
just with people closing in from both sides.

1156
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:22,649
And they get pressed together,

1157
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,879
they can't fight properly,

1158
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,289
they panic,

1159
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:26,999
and they're all slaughtered.

1160
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,359
And that strategy of double envelopment,

1161
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,140
of sort of going around both sides

1162
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:34,949
becomes the model for all kinds of military strategies

1163
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,809
throughout the rest of history.

1164
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,218
I mean, the Germans use this,

1165
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,868
and their blitzkrieg in World War II,

1166
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:41,459
a lot of it was kind of that, you know,

1167
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,040
go around the sides and envelop the enemy.

1168
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,178
On the eastern front,

1169
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:47,879
they had a bunch of these sort of cauldron battles

1170
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,713
where they would go around

1171
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:51,149
and try to encircle huge chunks

1172
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,219
of the Soviet, the Russian army,

1173
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:54,779
and do the same thing.

1174
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,490
Supposedly, even in the Gulf War,

1175
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:59,308
it was part of the US strategy for the invasion of Iraq

1176
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:01,768
to do this kind of double envelopment maneuver.

1177
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,929
So it's something that for the rest of military history

1178
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:06,058
has been an inspiration to other armies.

1179
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:06,892
- Can you speak to the,

1180
00:44:06,893 --> 00:44:10,050
maybe the difference between heavy infantry and calvary?

1181
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,300
The usefulness of it in the ancient world?

1182
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,709
- The ancient world,

1183
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,290
sort of from the Greeks through the Romans,

1184
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:21,289
there's this consistent line of focusing on heavy infantry.

1185
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:23,218
So going back to Greece

1186
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:25,138
when they're fighting, let's say, Persia,

1187
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:27,839
which, at the time, was the superpower of the ancient world

1188
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,909
and vastly richer,

1189
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:32,759
vastly larger than ancient Greece,

1190
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,710
you know, tons more men.

1191
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,049
But the Persians tended to be archers,

1192
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,520
tended to be light horsemen,

1193
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:40,229
tended to be light infantry.

1194
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,560
Whereas the Greeks specialize in what are called hoplites,

1195
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,849
which is a kind of infantry men with very heavy body armor,

1196
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:49,528
a helmet, a spear,

1197
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,960
and a really big, heavy shield.

1198
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,339
And they would get in that formation

1199
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,770
where you kind of make the shields overlap

1200
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,259
and just form this solid mass

1201
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,790
bristling with spear points

1202
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:02,099
and just slowly kind of march forward

1203
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,498
and grind up your enemy in front of you.

1204
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,230
And so that sort of block of heavy infantry.

1205
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,399
The advantage is,

1206
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,870
head on, against other things,

1207
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:11,008
they tend to win.

1208
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,442
The disadvantage is, it's slow moving,

1209
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,679
it's vulnerable from the sides and the rear,

1210
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,419
so you gotta protect those.

1211
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,549
But if you can keep frontally faced,

1212
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,980
it's pretty much invincible.

1213
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,670
And that's taken even further by Alexander the Great

1214
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,589
who comes up with the idea,

1215
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,900
well, what if we even give them a longer spear?

1216
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,870
So Greek spears were six to eight feet long.

1217
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,542
Alexander the Great arms his armies with the sarissa,

1218
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:39,809
which is this 15-foot, almost a pike,

1219
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:41,639
this extra long spear.

1220
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:42,899
And so when the spear is that long,

1221
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,210
you don't even hardly need the shields anymore.

1222
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,759
So it's just this incredibly powerful thing

1223
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,320
in frontal attack.

1224
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,480
And that's what he uses to make himself

1225
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,709
ruler of the known world.

1226
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,870
He goes and conquers the Persian Empire

1227
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:56,909
and makes himself the Persian king of kings

1228
00:45:56,909 --> 00:46:01,766
with this phalanx of troops armed with the sarissa.

1229
00:46:01,766 --> 00:46:03,838
So that's very powerful.

1230
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,449
The Romans go a little bit different route.

1231
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:08,368
They have heavy infantry,

1232
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:11,339
but they focus more on fighting with short swords.

1233
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,799
So it's get up close and kind of stab.

1234
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,270
And the other thing the Romans do

1235
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:19,799
is they focus on flexibility

1236
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,929
and subdividing their army.

1237
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:25,649
So Alexander's phalanx was a mass of, let's say, 5,000 guys,

1238
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,240
and it was one unit.

1239
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:29,128
The Roman army is organized

1240
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:33,210
in an ever decreasing number of subunits.

1241
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,010
So you have a group of eight guys,

1242
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,530
who are a contubernium, the men who share a tent.

1243
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,460
You take 10 of those

1244
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,649
and they form a century of 80 men.

1245
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:42,450
You take a bunch of those and you form a cohort.

1246
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,848
You get a bunch of those, you form a legion.

1247
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:47,549
So the Romans are able to subdivide their army.

1248
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,730
And the big sticking point comes at 197 BC

1249
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,440
at the Battle of Cynoscephalae

1250
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,969
when the Roman Legion goes up against

1251
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:57,778
one of the descendants of Alexander the Great

1252
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,699
who's using his military system.

1253
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:02,819
So this is the new Roman system with flexibility

1254
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,179
versus the old, invincible Alexander system

1255
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:07,649
with the heavily armed sarissa

1256
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,170
with those long 15-foot poles.

1257
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,579
And the key moment in the battle is

1258
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,018
where they lock together,

1259
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:14,593
and in a head-on clash,

1260
00:47:14,594 --> 00:47:17,460
the Macedonians are gonna win,

1261
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,990
but the Romans have the flexibility

1262
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:20,789
to break off a little section of their army,

1263
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:21,988
run around to the side,

1264
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:23,998
and attack that formation from the side,

1265
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,379
and they win the battle.

1266
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,659
So they prove tactically superior

1267
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:29,519
because of their flexibility.

1268
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,349
So it's always development

1269
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,139
and counter development in military history.

1270
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:36,328
- A fascinating, brutal testing ground

1271
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:38,788
of tactics and technology.

1272
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,978
- Adaptation. You have to keep adapting.

1273
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,986
That's, I think, the key thing.

1274
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:44,490
- One of the fascinating things about your work,

1275
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:47,459
you study Roman life,

1276
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,980
life in the ancient world,

1277
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,710
but also the details, like we mentioned.

1278
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,633
You are an expert in armor.

1279
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,929
So what kind of,

1280
00:47:57,929 --> 00:47:59,338
maybe you could speak to weapons

1281
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,909
and, most importantly, armor that were used by the Romans

1282
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:04,622
or by people in the ancient world?

1283
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:06,748
- I do military history.

1284
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,540
So, I mean, the Romans specialized in...

1285
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:11,069
I mean, early on

1286
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,900
they have pretty random armor

1287
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,220
and it's not standardized.

1288
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,408
I mean, remember there's no factories in the ancient world,

1289
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:18,779
so nobody's cranking out 10,000 units

1290
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,860
of exactly the same armor.

1291
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,630
Each one is handmade.

1292
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,639
Now, there could be a degree of standardization.

1293
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:24,868
Even as early as Alexander,

1294
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,849
there was a certain amount of standardization.

1295
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:28,918
But each one is still handmade,

1296
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,569
and that's important to keep in mind.

1297
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,763
Each weapon, each piece of armor.

1298
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:36,298
Armor develops over time to fit the tactics.

1299
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,659
So the Greek hoplites are very heavy armor.

1300
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:41,219
The Roman infantrymen,

1301
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,259
early in the republic, is lighter.

1302
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,909
Eventually, they get this typical sort of,

1303
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:47,879
you know, chain mail shirt, helmet, shield.

1304
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,100
The classic sort of Roman legionnaire, I would say,

1305
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,469
is the one of the first and second centuries AD,

1306
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:54,329
so the early Roman Empire.

1307
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:58,678
And this is the guy who wore bands of steel

1308
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:01,379
arranged in sort of bands around their body.

1309
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,839
So it looks almost like a lobster's shell, right?

1310
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,530
And this is a thing called the lorica segmentata.

1311
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,010
So it's solid steel,

1312
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,090
which is very good protection,

1313
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,110
but it's flexible

1314
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,480
because it has these individual bands

1315
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,159
that provide a lot of movement.

1316
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,479
And then you have a helmet,

1317
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,129
you have a square shield

1318
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,269
that's kind of curved,

1319
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:19,589
and you have the short sword,

1320
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,539
the Roman gladius.

1321
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:23,700
And that's kind of the classic Roman legionnaire.

1322
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:26,458
Later, more things develop.

1323
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,520
My personal sort of relationship with armor

1324
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,338
is I got, really, by accident,

1325
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,930
involved in this project

1326
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:38,098
to try to reconstruct this mysterious type of armor

1327
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,438
that was used especially by the Greeks

1328
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,700
and Alexander the Great

1329
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:43,588
called the linothorax,

1330
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,830
which, apparently, was made only out of linen and glue.

1331
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,389
So this seems a little odd that, you know,

1332
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:49,739
that's not the sort of material

1333
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:52,267
once you want metal or something.

1334
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:54,630
But we had clear literary references

1335
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,946
that people, including Alexander,

1336
00:49:55,947 --> 00:49:57,959
and the most famous image of Alexander

1337
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,319
is this Alexander Mosaic, found at Pompeii,

1338
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,430
that shows him wearing one of these funny types of armor.

1339
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:08,339
The catch is none survived.

1340
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,229
It's organic materials.

1341
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,450
So we don't have any of them.

1342
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:16,078
And archeologists like to study things that survive.

1343
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,559
So we have nice typologies of Greek armor made of bronze,

1344
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,708
Roman armor made of steel or sort of proto steel,

1345
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,989
but this thing, this linothorax,

1346
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,489
was a mystery.

1347
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:29,129
And of my undergraduate students,

1348
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,359
a guy named Scott Bartel,

1349
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,360
had a real, well, an Alexander obsession.

1350
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,569
He really loved Alexander. - As one should.

1351
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,790
- He had Alexandros tattooed on his arm in Greek.

1352
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:41,248
And he was a smart student, he was really smart.

1353
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,730
And so he, one summer, made himself an imitation

1354
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:47,759
of this thing of Alexanders just for fun.

1355
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,949
And he said, you know, "Can you give me some articles

1356
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:51,269
so I could do a better job?"

1357
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:53,818
So I used some scholarly articles about this armor.

1358
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,680
And with typical sort of, you know, academic arrogance,

1359
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:57,358
I said, "Why, Scott, of course I will.

1360
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,890
I'll give you some references."

1361
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,228
And I went and looked and there weren't any.

1362
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,197
So at that point, I was like,

1363
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:04,589
"Huh, tell you what,

1364
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,049
why don't you and I look into this

1365
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,929
and try to do a reconstruction

1366
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:11,568
using only the materials they would've had

1367
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,260
in the ancient world?"

1368
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,863
And little did I know at the time,

1369
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:16,271
I thought maybe I'll get an article out of this.

1370
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,229
I mean, it ended up being a 10-year project

1371
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,200
involving, you know, 150 students,

1372
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:25,098
a couple dozen other faculty members,

1373
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:26,819
you know, ended up having three documentaries

1374
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,653
made out of it,

1375
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:30,168
and Scott and I ended up writing a scholarly book on this.

1376
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,619
So this is how, you know,

1377
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:34,109
you never know where your next project's gonna come from.

1378
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,670
So it started with this undergraduate

1379
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,079
turned into this huge thing.

1380
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:37,919
But it's what we did.

1381
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,847
We first said, "All right,

1382
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:41,730
what are all the sources for this armor?"

1383
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:42,630
And in the end,

1384
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:47,250
we found 65 accounts of it in ancient literature

1385
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,780
by 40 different authors.

1386
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,090
So we have literary descriptions.

1387
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,130
And then we looked at ancient art

1388
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,370
and we were able to identify about a thousand images

1389
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:57,659
in ancient art.

1390
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:01,319
In vase paintings, pottery,

1391
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,420
bronze sculpture, tomb paintings,

1392
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,940
all these different things showing this armor.

1393
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,800
And then using those two things,

1394
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,170
we tried to backwards engineer a pattern

1395
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,359
to say, well, if this is what the end product look like,

1396
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,249
what does it have to look like when you make it?

1397
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,040
And then we tried to reconstruct one of these things

1398
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:19,378
using only the glue and materials.

1399
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,609
So we had to use, you know,

1400
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,710
animal glues, rabbit glue.

1401
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,250
We had to end up sort of making our own linen,

1402
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,350
which comes from the flax plant.

1403
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,538
So we had to grow flax,

1404
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:33,029
harvest it using only techniques in the ancient world.

1405
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,159
So modern flax goes through chemical processes.

1406
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:37,139
No, we had to do this the old fashioned way.

1407
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:38,399
Spin it into thread,

1408
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,380
sew the thread into fabric,

1409
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,730
glued all together.

1410
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,169
And then the fun part was,

1411
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,280
once we made these things,

1412
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,739
we subjected them to ballistics testing.

1413
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:48,989
So we shot them with arrows,

1414
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:51,598
which, again, were wooden reconstruction arrows,

1415
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,978
using bronze arrowheads

1416
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,520
that were based on arrowheads found on ancient battlefields

1417
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:59,999
to determine how good protection would this thing have been.

1418
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,110
And of course,

1419
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,940
the kind of fun one that everyone always likes

1420
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,200
and that the documentaries always want

1421
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:05,032
is, at one point, they're like,

1422
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:07,169
"Well, can you put Scott in one of these and shoot him?"

1423
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,929
- Yeah. - And we're like, "Okay."

1424
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:10,762
I mean, at that point,

1425
00:53:10,762 --> 00:53:12,058
we'd done about a thousand test shots.

1426
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,978
I grew up shooting bows and arrows,

1427
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,230
I knew exactly how far that was gonna go.

1428
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,140
So it's one of these "Don't do this at home, kids."

1429
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:20,669
- So there's a million questions to ask here,

1430
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,750
but, you know, in general,

1431
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,790
how well, in terms of ballistics, does it work?

1432
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:26,699
Like can it withstand arrows

1433
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:28,739
or direct strikes from like swords

1434
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,999
and axes and stuff like that?

1435
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,169
- Bottom line is a one centimeter thick linothorax,

1436
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,870
so laminated, or even sewn,

1437
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:38,248
it doesn't have to be laminated,

1438
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,139
layer of linen

1439
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,999
is about as good protection

1440
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,129
as two millimeters of bronze,

1441
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,529
which was the thickest comparable

1442
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,719
body armor of bronze at the time.

1443
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,719
And we're talking fourth century, fifth century BC here.

1444
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:57,089
So Classical and Hellenistic Greece.

1445
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,950
And that would've protected you from,

1446
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:01,889
let's say, random aero strikes on the battlefield.

1447
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:04,529
So you could have gotten hit by arrows

1448
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,510
and they simply wouldn't have gone through.

1449
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,500
- What are the benefits?

1450
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,480
So is there a major weight difference?

1451
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,879
- Yes. So the benefits of this are,

1452
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,370
it's much lighter than metal armor.

1453
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:17,339
So the linothorax is about 11 pounds.

1454
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,580
A bronze cuirass of comparable protection

1455
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:23,938
would've been about 24 to six pounds.

1456
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,569
A chain mail shirt would be about 28, 27 pounds.

1457
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,440
It's cooler.

1458
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,460
I mean, you know,

1459
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,080
the Mediterranean is a hot place

1460
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,609
with the hot sun.

1461
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,019
Even today, you know, a linen shirt

1462
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:35,759
is something you wear when you want to be cool.

1463
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,020
So it's much lighter,

1464
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:39,568
that gives you troops greater endurance on the battlefield.

1465
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,210
They can run farther, fight longer.

1466
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,290
It's cheaper.

1467
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:44,639
You don't need a blacksmith,

1468
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:46,379
who's a specialist, to make it.

1469
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,059
In fact, probably, this is interesting,

1470
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:50,338
any woman in the ancient world

1471
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,779
could have made one of these

1472
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,960
because they were the ones who spun thread

1473
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,419
and sewed it into fabric.

1474
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,060
So I can easily see, in a household,

1475
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,919
a mother making this for her son,

1476
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,080
a wife making it for her husband.

1477
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,248
So it's a form of armor you could have made domestically.

1478
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,090
That would've been, you know,

1479
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,560
maybe not the greatest armor,

1480
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,849
but pretty good,

1481
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:13,978
pretty comparable to bronze armor.

1482
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,240
- And it's amazing that you used

1483
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:16,799
all the materials they had at the time

1484
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,540
and none of the modern techniques.

1485
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:19,706
But I should probably say,

1486
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:21,269
and maybe you can speak to that,

1487
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:23,429
they were probably much better at doing that

1488
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:26,699
than you are, right, because like,

1489
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,038
you know, again, generational, it's a skill,

1490
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:31,259
and it's a skill that probably has practiced across decades,

1491
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,512
across centuries with the...

1492
00:55:32,512 --> 00:55:35,129
- I mean, in terms of producing the fabric,

1493
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,860
I'm sure they could do it 10 times faster than we could,

1494
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,059
just that's a speed thing,

1495
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,248
but it's still incredibly labor intensive.

1496
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,720
Where I think there's a big difference

1497
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,728
between our reconstruction and ancient ones

1498
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:45,959
is in the glue.

1499
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,010
So we ended up using

1500
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,409
a kind of least common denominator glue.

1501
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:50,879
We used rabbit glue

1502
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,100
because it would've been available anywhere

1503
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:53,932
and it's cheap.

1504
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,250
But in the ancient world,

1505
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,459
they did have basically the equivalent of super glues.

1506
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,980
I mean, we found, for example,

1507
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,350
helmets that were fished out of a river in Germany

1508
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:07,319
that had metal parts glued together

1509
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,420
that after 2000 years of immersion in water

1510
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,859
were still glued together.

1511
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,360
So they had some great glues,

1512
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,850
we just don't know what the recipes for them were.

1513
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:16,506
So we went the opposite tack and said,

1514
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:17,850
"Well, we're just gonna make something

1515
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,528
that we know they could have made."

1516
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,889
So it was at least this good, you know what I'm saying?

1517
00:56:22,889 --> 00:56:25,829
- But actually, this is a materials thing,

1518
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:27,302
but I think glue,

1519
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:33,359
aside from helping glue things together,

1520
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,210
it can also be a thing that serves as armor.

1521
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,520
So like if you glue things correctly,

1522
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:42,688
the way it permeates the material that is gluing

1523
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,452
can strengthen the material,

1524
00:56:44,452 --> 00:56:45,629
the integrity of the material.

1525
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:46,710
That's an art and a science

1526
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,060
probably that they understood deeply.

1527
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:50,279
- The process of lamination did add something.

1528
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,889
So there's actually a huge debate among scholars

1529
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:55,168
and actually a sort of amateur archeologist

1530
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,500
that was this linothorax thing glued together

1531
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,360
or was it simply sewn together?

1532
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,310
Was it composite, partially linen,

1533
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:04,349
partially leather, or other materials?

1534
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:07,259
And my honest answer is, I think it's all of the above,

1535
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,900
because, again, every piece of armor in the ancient world

1536
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,789
was an individual creation.

1537
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:13,619
So I think if you had some spare leather,

1538
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:14,699
you put that in.

1539
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,189
If you wanted to make one that was just sewn together,

1540
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,680
even quilted stuffed with stuff, you do that.

1541
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,868
Maybe you were good at gluing stuff, you used that.

1542
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:23,639
So I think there's no one answer.

1543
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:26,549
We investigated one possibility

1544
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:28,500
because we just had limited time

1545
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,120
and money and resources.

1546
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,969
But I think all these other things existed at the same time

1547
00:57:32,969 --> 00:57:34,648
and were variants of it.

1548
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,210
- Just as a small aside,

1549
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,640
I just think this is a fascinating journey you went on.

1550
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:40,129
I love it.

1551
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:44,070
That sort of answering really important questions

1552
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,369
about, in this case, armor,

1553
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:50,668
about military equipment and technology

1554
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,009
that archeologists can't answer

1555
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,899
by using all the literate.

1556
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,309
So all the sources you can

1557
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,142
to understand what it looked like,

1558
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:58,620
what were the materials,

1559
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:00,145
using the materials at the time,

1560
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:02,669
and actually doing ballistic testing.

1561
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:03,630
It's really cool.

1562
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,819
It's really cool that it's,

1563
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,340
you see that there's a hole in the literature.

1564
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,360
Nobody studied it

1565
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,020
and going hard and doing it the right way

1566
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:14,492
to sort of uncovered this.

1567
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,499
I don't know.

1568
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,810
I think it's an amazing mystery about the ancient world.

1569
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:19,739
- I mean, shifting from

1570
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:21,089
just sort of Roman history in general

1571
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,549
to my research that I've done as a scholar,

1572
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,380
the theme that runs throughout my scholarship

1573
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,910
is practical stuff.

1574
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:27,742
I'm interested,

1575
00:58:27,742 --> 00:58:28,709
how did this actually work

1576
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,909
in the ancient world?

1577
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:32,339
So there's people who are much more theoretical,

1578
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,173
who look at, you know,

1579
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:34,948
the symbolic meaning of something.

1580
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:35,909
I'm simpler.

1581
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:38,129
I just wanna know how did this work.

1582
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,350
So almost all of my books that I've written

1583
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:42,958
have started with some just how did something work.

1584
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,450
And I'm trying to just figure out that aspect of it.

1585
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:46,319
And that's just,

1586
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,449
maybe it's a personality thing.

1587
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:50,399
I also have kind of a sciencey background,

1588
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,500
so I think I've used a lot of that.

1589
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,689
Even though I'm a humanist and a historian,

1590
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:59,220
I used a lot of kind of hard science in my work.

1591
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:00,448
I did a book on floods

1592
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:01,858
where I had to get really heavy into,

1593
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,450
you know, vectors of disease

1594
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:04,769
and, you know, hydraulics

1595
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:06,329
and engineering and all that stuff.

1596
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:08,849
And I think, again, having that sort of hard science

1597
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,858
combined with a humanist background

1598
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,539
helps with those sorts of projects.

1599
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:13,372
- Well, like you said,

1600
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:15,240
I think the details help you understand deeply

1601
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:16,888
the big picture of history.

1602
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:19,319
And, I mean, Alexander the Great wore this thing.

1603
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,153
- Yeah. - So this is...

1604
00:59:20,152 --> 00:59:21,928
- And I should say, by the way,

1605
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:25,409
it does drop out of use around Roman times.

1606
00:59:25,409 --> 00:59:28,236
And I think what's going on there is technology.

1607
00:59:28,237 --> 00:59:29,820
That with bronze,

1608
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,550
it's hard to keep a sharp edge on things,

1609
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:33,870
but once you get into metals,

1610
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,219
which approximate steel,

1611
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:37,079
you can get sharper.

1612
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,349
And a key factor to penetrating fabric

1613
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:43,108
is the edge on the arrowhead, right?

1614
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,519
So as soon as you start to get something

1615
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,869
more like a razor edge,

1616
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:47,548
it's gonna go through it more easily.

1617
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,130
Also, there's changes in the bows that are being used.

1618
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:53,520
You start to get sort of eastern horse archers showing up

1619
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:54,839
with composite bows,

1620
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,489
which are much more powerful.

1621
00:59:56,489 --> 00:59:58,529
And so it just becomes outdated

1622
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,750
as frontline military equipment.

1623
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,399
What's interesting is by the Roman period,

1624
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,750
people are still wearing it,

1625
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,850
but it's now things like when I go hunting.

1626
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:08,009
If I'm hunting lions, I wear this.

1627
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:08,843
There's an actual source.

1628
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:11,579
It says it's really good for hunting dangerous big cats

1629
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,929
because it catches their teeth

1630
01:00:12,929 --> 01:00:15,032
and stops them from penetrating.

1631
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:18,419
One emperor wears one of these under his togas,

1632
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,460
kind of like a, not bulletproof vest,

1633
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,290
but stab proof vest.

1634
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:25,079
So again, it's not to fight in the front line of legions,

1635
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,369
but it'll protect him from somebody

1636
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:28,018
trying to assassinate him.

1637
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:29,579
So it still has those uses

1638
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:32,998
where you're not up against top line military equipment.

1639
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,940
- To honor the aforementioned undergraduate student

1640
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,379
who loves Alexander the Great,

1641
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,789
we must absolutely talk about

1642
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:41,248
Alexander the Great for a little bit.

1643
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,479
Why was he successful,

1644
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,040
do you think, as a conqueror,

1645
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:46,469
probably one of the greatest conquerors

1646
01:00:46,469 --> 01:00:48,392
in the history of humanity?

1647
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,079
- Yeah. And I mean, he's then one of the greatest heroes

1648
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,049
or one of the greatest villains in humanity too.

1649
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,489
It's like Julius Caesar.

1650
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:57,989
He's famous for conquering Gaul.

1651
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:59,095
Well, about a million people were killed

1652
01:00:59,097 --> 01:01:00,720
and a million enslaved in that.

1653
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:03,089
So does it make him a horrible person

1654
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,050
or one of our heroes?

1655
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,710
But Alexander is a combination of two things.

1656
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:10,410
One is he really just was a skilled individual,

1657
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:12,088
and he was one of those guys who had it all.

1658
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,099
He was smart, he was athletic,

1659
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:16,349
and he was supremely charismatic.

1660
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:17,609
I mean, it's obviously one of these people

1661
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,930
that would walk into a room

1662
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,789
and everyone just kind of gravitates to him.

1663
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:24,212
He had that magic that made him an effective leader.

1664
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:29,609
And secondly, he was lucky because it wasn't all him.

1665
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:34,499
He inherited a system created by his father, Philip II.

1666
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,810
So he was in the right time at the right place

1667
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:39,809
and had this instrument placed in his hands,

1668
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:42,478
and then he had the intelligence

1669
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,460
and the charisma to go use it.

1670
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,919
So it's one of these coming together of different things.

1671
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,410
But often, his father's contribution,

1672
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:52,349
I think, is not recognized as much as it is.

1673
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:54,989
It's his father who reformed the Macedonian army,

1674
01:01:54,989 --> 01:01:56,368
who came up with that system

1675
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:57,778
of equipping them with the sarissa,

1676
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,690
this extra long spear that made them really effective,

1677
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,879
created the mixed army.

1678
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,580
So one of the keys to Alexander's successes

1679
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:07,619
on a tactical sense

1680
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:10,889
is that his army was composed of different elements:

1681
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:12,808
heavy cavalry, light cavalry,

1682
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:14,458
heavy infantry, light infantry,

1683
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,420
missile troops.

1684
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,670
And he understand that he can use these

1685
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,580
in different and flexible ways on the battlefield,

1686
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:22,258
whereas a lot of warfare before then

1687
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,760
had just been, you line up,

1688
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,590
two sides smashed together.

1689
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,409
So he did clever things with this army

1690
01:02:28,409 --> 01:02:30,509
that was a better tool than others did.

1691
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,300
And then he was just supremely ambitious.

1692
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,969
I mean, he cared about his fame,

1693
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:37,559
which I guess is ego,

1694
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:39,149
but he clearly cared about that

1695
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,819
more than he did about things like money.

1696
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,818
He was indifferent to that.

1697
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:47,010
And he did have a grand vision.

1698
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,460
So he did have this vision of trying to unite the world,

1699
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,560
both politically, under his control,

1700
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,998
but also culturally.

1701
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,679
And this is an interesting thing.

1702
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:57,299
So he was very open,

1703
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,079
in fact, insistent of trying to meld together

1704
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,989
the best elements of all the different cultures.

1705
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,912
So he himself was a Macedonian,

1706
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,220
but he admired Greek culture.

1707
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:10,949
So he pretty much adopted Greek cultures his own.

1708
01:03:10,949 --> 01:03:12,449
When he conquers Persia,

1709
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:14,848
he starts adapting elements of Persian culture.

1710
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:16,409
He dresses in Persian clothing,

1711
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:18,179
he marries a Persian woman,

1712
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:20,909
he sort of forces thousands of his troops

1713
01:03:20,909 --> 01:03:22,439
to marry local women,

1714
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,899
he appoints Persians to positions of power,

1715
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,840
he integrates Persian units into his military.

1716
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,960
He really wanted to fuse all these things together.

1717
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,160
And some people see this as a very enlightened vision

1718
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:37,046
that, oh, he's not just, "I wanna conquer people

1719
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,760
and now they're my slaves."

1720
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,829
That he was really trying to create this one culture

1721
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:42,718
that was sort of the best of everything.

1722
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,509
Others see it, of course, as a form of cultural imperialism.

1723
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,760
You're destroying other cultures

1724
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,630
and trying to warp or twist them into something.

1725
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:52,950
But what I think is interesting

1726
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:56,788
is that this vision he had of uniting cultures

1727
01:03:56,789 --> 01:04:01,789
creates very problematic tensions among his own followers.

1728
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,179
Because the Macedonians, his original troops,

1729
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,518
did not like this on the whole.

1730
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,146
They wanted the old model where

1731
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,719
"We conquer you, you're our slaves.

1732
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:14,279
We don't wanna share stuff with you,

1733
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,020
we don't want you joining us in the army,

1734
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,046
we don't want you appointed to positions of power.

1735
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:20,010
We are your conquerors, and that's it."

1736
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,400
And so Alexander had to deal with a lot of friction

1737
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,640
from his own oldest, most loyal elements

1738
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:28,918
at the way he was being, in their eyes,

1739
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,903
too generous to the conquered.

1740
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,869
So Alexander is one of these interesting personalities

1741
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:37,648
because every generation sees him in a new light

1742
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,750
and focuses on different things.

1743
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,810
So for some, he's this enlightened visionary

1744
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:44,339
who is taught by Aristotle,

1745
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,300
the Greek philosopher,

1746
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,739
and they say, "Well, this influenced him."

1747
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:49,859
Others see him as an egomaniacal war monger,

1748
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,290
just "I'm out to kill and gain glory."

1749
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:53,639
There was a book a couple decades ago,

1750
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,469
it says, "Oh, he is just an alcoholic,"

1751
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:56,868
which he probably was, yeah.

1752
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,1000
So you get all these competing images,

1753
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,450
and the great thing is we don't really know

1754
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:05,399
what the true Alexander was

1755
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,053
or what his motivations were.

1756
01:05:07,052 --> 01:05:09,029
It's a mixed message.

1757
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:13,792
- Why do you think the Roman Empire lasted

1758
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,860
while the Greek Empire,

1759
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:21,029
as the Alexander expanded, did not?

1760
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:22,020
- That's a clear answer.

1761
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:26,639
So Alexander's empire fragmented the moment he died.

1762
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,148
And so his empire was all about personal loyalty.

1763
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,219
It was his charisma holding it together,

1764
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,448
his personality,

1765
01:05:33,449 --> 01:05:38,008
and he completely failed to create a structure

1766
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,600
so that it would continue after his death.

1767
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,529
And of course he died young.

1768
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,060
He didn't think he would die when he did,

1769
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:44,579
but still you should put something in place.

1770
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:46,978
So his was a flash in the pan.

1771
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,160
It was, he had this spectacular conquest in 10 years,

1772
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,099
he conquered what was then most of the known world,

1773
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,319
but he had no permanent structure in place.

1774
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,900
He didn't really deal with the issue of succession.

1775
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,579
It fell apart instantly.

1776
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:03,809
The Romans are much more about building a structure.

1777
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:05,740
So, I mean, as we talked about a little,

1778
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,828
they were very good about incorporating

1779
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:11,159
the people they conquered into the Roman project.

1780
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:12,298
I mean, they're oppressive,

1781
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,920
they're imperialistic as well.

1782
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,329
Let's not whitewash them.

1783
01:06:15,329 --> 01:06:16,162
I mean, they had moments

1784
01:06:16,163 --> 01:06:19,110
when they would just wipe out entire cities.

1785
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,489
But on the whole,

1786
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:22,439
they were much more about trying to bring people

1787
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,600
into the Roman world.

1788
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,369
And I think that was one of their strengths

1789
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:29,759
is that they were open to integration

1790
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,380
and bringing in different people

1791
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,350
to keep rejuvenating themselves.

1792
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:35,969
- One of the most influential developments

1793
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:37,138
from the Roman Republic

1794
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:38,759
was their legal system.

1795
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,630
And as you mentioned,

1796
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:43,020
it's one of the things that still lasted to this day

1797
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:44,341
in many of its elements.

1798
01:06:45,329 --> 01:06:48,989
So it started with the Twelve Tables in 451 BC.

1799
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:51,058
Can you just speak to this legal system

1800
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:51,899
and the Twelve Tables?

1801
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,690
- Yeah. I mean, Roman law is one of their most significant,

1802
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,790
maybe the most significant legacy they have

1803
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:57,809
on the modern world.

1804
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,998
So, I mean, just to start at that end of it,

1805
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,160
something like, you know, 90% of the world

1806
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:03,388
uses a legal system,

1807
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:04,439
which is either directly

1808
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,719
or indirectly derived from the Roman one.

1809
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:09,178
So even countries that you wouldn't think

1810
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:10,378
are really using Roman law

1811
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,900
kind of are because all the terminology,

1812
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,493
all that comes from Roman law.

1813
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,429
And the Romans, their first law code

1814
01:07:17,429 --> 01:07:18,899
was this thing, the Twelve Tables.

1815
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,666
So this is way back in the Middle Republic,

1816
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:25,618
and it was a typical early law code.

1817
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:30,418
So most of the stuff it concerns are agricultural concerns.

1818
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,829
So if I have a tree

1819
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:33,898
and it's fruit drops onto your property,

1820
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,069
who owns the fruit?

1821
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:37,079
If my cow wanders into your field

1822
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:39,442
and eats your grain, am I responsible?

1823
01:07:39,443 --> 01:07:41,580
I mean, I love these early law codes

1824
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:42,412
that are all about this,

1825
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:44,969
like farmer problems, you know?

1826
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:46,648
But law codes are hugely important

1827
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:49,049
because you need a law code

1828
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,509
to enable people to live in groups.

1829
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:53,760
So they're the transitional thing

1830
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,010
that lets human beings live together

1831
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:58,349
without just resorting to anarchy.

1832
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:01,108
And most of the early law codes are agricultural,

1833
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,480
like Hammurabi's Code in Mesopotamia.

1834
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,310
Most of them are retaliatory,

1835
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:08,188
meaning eye for an eye type justice.

1836
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,770
So you do something to me, it gets done to you.

1837
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:13,349
But they're this necessary precondition

1838
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:15,449
for civilization, I would say.

1839
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:18,719
And the Twelve Tables is that it's a crude law code,

1840
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,270
it has a lot of goofy stuff in it,

1841
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,080
it has things about, you know,

1842
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:25,259
if you use magic, this is the punishment,

1843
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:28,590
but it's that basic agrarian society law code.

1844
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:30,659
Now, that's typical in many societies.

1845
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:33,899
Where the Romans are different is they keep going,

1846
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:36,119
they keep developing their law code.

1847
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:38,398
And by the late republic,

1848
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,099
the Romans just get kind of really into legal stuff.

1849
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,473
I don't know why, but...

1850
01:08:42,472 --> 01:08:45,539
And the Romans are very methodical, organized people,

1851
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:47,668
so maybe this has something to do with it.

1852
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,410
But their law code just keeps getting

1853
01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:51,239
more and more complicated

1854
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:53,219
and keeps expanding to different areas.

1855
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,510
And they start to get juris

1856
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:57,692
who write sort of theoretical things about Roman law.

1857
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,260
And eventually, it becomes this huge body,

1858
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,679
both of cases and comments on those cases

1859
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,780
and of actual laws.

1860
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:10,742
And in the 6th century AD, so the 500s,

1861
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,200
the Roman Emperor Justinian,

1862
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:16,739
who is a emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire by this point,

1863
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:17,938
the Byzantine Empire,

1864
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:20,008
compiles all this together into something

1865
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:21,720
that today we just kinda loosely called

1866
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,820
Justinian's Code of Roman Law,

1867
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:25,166
and that survives.

1868
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,910
And so that becomes the basis

1869
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:29,009
for almost all the legal systems around the world.

1870
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:30,957
And it's very complicated.

1871
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:32,880
And Roman law, I think, is really fun,

1872
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,250
because on the one hand, it's really dry,

1873
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,319
but it also preserves these wonderful,

1874
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,718
little vignettes of daily life.

1875
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,929
So you get these great just kind of entertaining law cases.

1876
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:43,800
One of my favorite,

1877
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,090
and this may not even be a real case,

1878
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:46,259
this might be a hypothetical

1879
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,429
that they would use like to train

1880
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,530
Roman sort of, you know, law students,

1881
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:52,109
is like one day a man sends a slave

1882
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:54,118
to the barber to get a shave,

1883
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:57,748
and the barbershop is adjacent to an athletic field.

1884
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,520
And two guys are on the athletic field

1885
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,959
throwing a ball back and forth.

1886
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,450
And one of them throws the ball badly,

1887
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,309
the other guy fails to catch it,

1888
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,229
the ball flies into the barbershop,

1889
01:10:07,229 --> 01:10:08,549
hits the hand of the barber,

1890
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,099
cuts the slave's throat, he dies.

1891
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,439
Who's liable under Roman law?

1892
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:16,318
Is it the athlete one who threw the ball badly,

1893
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,439
is it athlete two who failed to catch it,

1894
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:21,179
is the barber who actually cut the slave's throat,

1895
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,130
is it the owner of the slave

1896
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:26,009
for being stupid enough to send his slave

1897
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:29,219
to get a shave in a place adjacent to a playing field,

1898
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,599
or is it the Roman state

1899
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,410
rezoning a barbershop next to an athletic field?

1900
01:10:34,409 --> 01:10:35,578
What do you think?

1901
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:38,159
- Well, do they resolve the complexity of that

1902
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,749
with the right answer?

1903
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,614
- We don't have the answer. - We don't have the answer.

1904
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:43,554
- It's a case without the answer.

1905
01:10:43,555 --> 01:10:47,430
So we have various juris commenting on this one,

1906
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,619
but we don't have what was actually ruled.

1907
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:52,949
But it's just a great little, you know, sort of vignette.

1908
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,989
And that's how complicated Roman law got

1909
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:58,589
that it was dealing with these weird, esoteric questions.

1910
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:00,269
There's another one where, you know,

1911
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:03,569
a cow gets loose and runs into an apartment building,

1912
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:04,679
goes up onto the roof,

1913
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,050
and crashes down three stories into a bar

1914
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,310
on the ground floor,

1915
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:11,339
and kicks open the taps to the wine jug,

1916
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,930
and all the wine flows out,

1917
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,309
who's at fault?

1918
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,260
I mean, this seems to have happened

1919
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,003
as crazy as it sounds.

1920
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,940
And Roman testamentary law is great.

1921
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:22,469
I mean, something like 20% of Roman law

1922
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,699
has to do with wills

1923
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:24,868
and what you do with the will

1924
01:11:24,869 --> 01:11:27,200
and what makes a will valid.

1925
01:11:27,202 --> 01:11:28,861
You know, you have to have seven witnesses,

1926
01:11:28,862 --> 01:11:29,695
and you have to have a guy named

1927
01:11:29,694 --> 01:11:31,439
the liber friends to witness it,

1928
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:33,088
and the witnesses have to be adult men

1929
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:34,319
who can't be blind

1930
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:36,539
and all this other stuff.

1931
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:37,372
So it's just great.

1932
01:11:37,372 --> 01:11:38,999
I mean, it's fun to mess around in this,

1933
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,800
but it always contains these little nuggets

1934
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,780
about what happens.

1935
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:44,639
I mentioned, I wrote a book on floods.

1936
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,500
And there were all these law cases about

1937
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,270
if a flood strikes the city

1938
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,870
and picks up my piece of furniture in my apartment building

1939
01:11:51,869 --> 01:11:53,129
and carries it out the door

1940
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,110
and deposits it in another apartment building,

1941
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:56,998
does that guy now own my furniture

1942
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,730
because it's now legally within his apartment?

1943
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:01,005
Or can I go in there and repossess it

1944
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:03,898
'cause the flood took it out of my apartment?

1945
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:05,699
You know, this is the stuff laws handled.

1946
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:08,098
And that's how sophisticated Roman law got

1947
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,970
- Did kind of corrupt, unfair things seep into the law?

1948
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:12,803
- Oh, yeah.

1949
01:12:12,802 --> 01:12:15,599
I mean, it's biased in favor of the wealthy, obviously.

1950
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,729
And, I mean, you know,

1951
01:12:17,729 --> 01:12:21,599
Roman law cases are interesting

1952
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,780
because they became linked to politics.

1953
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:26,609
So one of the way that politicians,

1954
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,919
up and coming politicians, aspiring politicians

1955
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,180
could sort of make their name

1956
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,559
or become famous

1957
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,510
was by either prosecuting

1958
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,760
or defending people in Roman law courts.

1959
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,002
And especially during the late Roman Republic,

1960
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,999
you get a lot of really sensational,

1961
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,430
what today we'd call celebrity law cases.

1962
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,559
So this is where some of the biggest politicians

1963
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,060
were accused of very melodramatic kinds of things.

1964
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,269
And, I mean, the most famous Roman orator of all time,

1965
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,409
Cicero,

1966
01:12:55,409 --> 01:12:57,989
is a guy who made his entire career

1967
01:12:57,989 --> 01:12:59,368
in the law courts,

1968
01:12:59,369 --> 01:13:00,959
and that's how he made his reputation,

1969
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,690
was able to parlay that into political power,

1970
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:05,669
and eventually was elected to the highest office

1971
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:06,839
in the Roman government.

1972
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,909
But it's purely because of his skill,

1973
01:13:08,909 --> 01:13:11,609
his facility at using words,

1974
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:13,678
at giving speeches in public.

1975
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,189
- So they loved the puzzle and the game of law,

1976
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:22,189
the sort of untangling really complicated legal situations

1977
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,269
and coming up with new laws

1978
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,641
that help you tangle and untangle the situations?

1979
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,759
- Yes, and law cases, again,

1980
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,899
especially in the late republic,

1981
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:33,599
also became a form of public spectacle.

1982
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,519
So, Rome did not have law courts in a building locked away.

1983
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,399
A lot of these cases were held in the Roman forum,

1984
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:42,419
in the open,

1985
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,810
and audiences would just come to be entertained.

1986
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:47,939
And the people presenting the speeches there

1987
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:50,159
were playing as much to this audience

1988
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,099
as they were to, let's say, the jury or a judge.

1989
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,050
And that became a big part of the cases.

1990
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,329
So that's all tied up in Roman oratory too.

1991
01:13:57,329 --> 01:14:01,708
- So we're talking a bit about the details of the laws.

1992
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,140
Is there some big picture laws

1993
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,080
that are new innovations or like profound things

1994
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:10,199
like all Roman citizens are equal before the law,

1995
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:13,708
kind of founding fathers type of in the United States,

1996
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:14,640
in the western world,

1997
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,979
these big legal ideas?

1998
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:19,289
- I think maybe one of the things

1999
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:21,539
that was really stressed in Roman law early on,

2000
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:23,039
even as early as the Twelve Tables,

2001
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:25,716
is the notion of Roman citizenship.

2002
01:14:25,716 --> 01:14:27,958
So if you were a Roman citizen,

2003
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,759
it came with a set of both privileges and obligations.

2004
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,080
So the obligations were

2005
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:35,488
you're supposed to fight in the army,

2006
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:37,319
you were supposed to vote in elections.

2007
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:40,379
The privileges were you had the protection of Roman law,

2008
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,529
and at least in theory, if not in practice,

2009
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:45,658
everybody was equal under that law.

2010
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:47,399
Now, of course, keep in mind,

2011
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,259
we're talking about men here.

2012
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,809
And even at the height of the Roman Empire,

2013
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,640
so let's say 2nd century AD,

2014
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,999
there were about 50 million human beings

2015
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,759
living within the boundaries of the Roman Empire.

2016
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,200
Maybe 6 million were actual citizens.

2017
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,066
So, you know, this is, we tend to go,

2018
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:07,680
"Oh, it's so great if you're a citizen,

2019
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,513
you have all these things."

2020
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:12,269
Well, adult free men who are not slaves,

2021
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:14,130
who are not resident foreigners,

2022
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,900
they have this great stuff.

2023
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:20,099
And that's always a tiny minority of all the human beings

2024
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,960
who existed in this society.

2025
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,790
But still, the notion,

2026
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:26,398
the notion of citizenship is huge.

2027
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:28,798
And citizens, for example, early on,

2028
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,479
you had to be tried at Rome

2029
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:32,309
if you were accused of something.

2030
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:35,490
And there's this very famous moment in Sicily

2031
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:39,449
where an abusive governor, who's corrupt,

2032
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:43,049
is punishing a citizen arbitrarily.

2033
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:46,230
And this person cries out "Civis Romanus sum,"

2034
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:49,048
meaning "I am a Roman citizen."

2035
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:52,500
And it really was this hugely loaded statement

2036
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,270
that gives me protections.

2037
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:56,490
It is wrong for you to do this to me.

2038
01:15:56,489 --> 01:15:58,079
It's wrong for you to beat me

2039
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,639
because I am a citizen,

2040
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,860
and that gives me certain protections.

2041
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:05,339
So that notion of citizenship is something that I think

2042
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,900
the Romans really emphasize

2043
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:10,318
and becomes a legacy to a lot of civilizations today

2044
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:12,059
where citizenship means something.

2045
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,979
It's a special status.

2046
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:17,128
- So you mentioned slaves, slavery,

2047
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:21,240
that's something that is common throughout human history.

2048
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:25,319
What do we know about their relationship with slavery?

2049
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:26,728
- Well, Roman slavery,

2050
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:28,439
a couple just reminders at the beginning,

2051
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:31,229
first of all, it's not racial slavery.

2052
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:33,329
So for people, you know, in the United States,

2053
01:16:33,329 --> 01:16:34,379
you tend to think of slavery

2054
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,299
through this kind of racial lens.

2055
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,880
So slaves in Ancient Roman society

2056
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,759
could be any color, ethnicity, gender,

2057
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,320
you know, origin, whatever.

2058
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:45,778
It's an economic status.

2059
01:16:45,779 --> 01:16:47,099
Now, having said that,

2060
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:51,810
slavery is fundamentally horrific to human dignity

2061
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:56,010
because it is defining a human being as an object.

2062
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,860
And very famously, a Roman agricultural writer,

2063
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:02,076
who's writing about farms just as a kind of aside, says,

2064
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:04,859
"You know, on your farm, you have three types of tools.

2065
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:07,618
You have dumb tools,

2066
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:09,119
and by dummy means can't speak.

2067
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:10,318
So that's like shovels,

2068
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:12,809
you know, picks things like this, wagons.

2069
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:16,319
You have semi-articulate tools, which are animals,

2070
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:18,899
and you have articulate tools,

2071
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:21,119
which are human beings, slaves."

2072
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:24,089
And for him, these are all just categories of tools.

2073
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:27,199
You know, it's so intensely dehumanizing

2074
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,489
to view people in that way.

2075
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:31,819
So Roman slavery is odd in that

2076
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,509
it doesn't have this racial component.

2077
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,269
It's horrible in the way all slavery is horrible.

2078
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:37,499
But the other thing about it is,

2079
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,770
it's not a hard line.

2080
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:42,510
It's a permeable membrane.

2081
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:46,050
And many people move back and forth across it.

2082
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:48,270
So you have many people in the Roman world

2083
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:50,669
who were born a slave who gained their freedom

2084
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,720
through one means or another.

2085
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,369
And you have many others who were born free

2086
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:54,629
and become slaves.

2087
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:56,759
And you have some who go back and forth.

2088
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,347
There's a great Roman tombstone of this guy who says,

2089
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,559
"I was born a free man in Parthia,

2090
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,969
I was enslaved,

2091
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,349
then I gained my freedom

2092
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,060
and I became a teacher or something,

2093
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:06,893
and I had a life,

2094
01:18:06,893 --> 01:18:08,280
and now I'm a Roman citizen."

2095
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:10,319
So it's this whole, like, back and forth

2096
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,439
across all these boundaries multiple times.

2097
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,269
- Oh, so there's probably a process,

2098
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,1000
like an economic transaction.

2099
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,439
- The most common source of slaves

2100
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:21,568
in the Roman world was war.

2101
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:24,209
So wherever the Roman army went,

2102
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:28,679
in its wake would be literally a train of slave traders.

2103
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,150
So you're in war,

2104
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:31,528
you capture an enemy city,

2105
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:32,968
you whack the people over the head,

2106
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,349
and you turn around if you're a soldier,

2107
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,060
and you sell them to one of these slave traders

2108
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,519
that's following the army around, literally.

2109
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,770
So that's probably the biggest source of slaves.

2110
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:43,653
Another big source is just children of slave or slaves.

2111
01:18:45,869 --> 01:18:48,268
And some people could literally sell

2112
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,330
either themselves or their children into slavery

2113
01:18:51,329 --> 01:18:54,569
due to economic, you know, necessity

2114
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:56,488
or privation or something.

2115
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:57,809
So as terrible as that sounds,

2116
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:02,162
a father could sell a child if he needed money.

2117
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:06,090
Once you were a slave though,

2118
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:09,420
the experience of slavery varied a lot

2119
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:13,830
because a lot of the slaves were agricultural slaves.

2120
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:15,329
So they would work sort of,

2121
01:19:15,329 --> 01:19:18,628
like in the American south, big plantations,

2122
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:19,799
they might be chained,

2123
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,179
they were probably abused.

2124
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:23,894
That's very similar to slavery as we think of it in,

2125
01:19:23,894 --> 01:19:25,019
you know, let's say the Caribbean,

2126
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:25,920
South America,

2127
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,809
or the United States prior to the Civil War,

2128
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,430
that kind of slavery.

2129
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,380
But a lot of Roman slaves

2130
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,170
were also some of the more skilled people.

2131
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,339
And this seems a little weird.

2132
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,440
So if you're a rich person, you have slaves,

2133
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,479
it's actually a good investment for you

2134
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:41,999
to train your slaves in a profession.

2135
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,919
So a lot of Roman doctors, scribes, accountants,

2136
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,170
sort of all this sort of thing, barbers,

2137
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:50,280
were slaves,

2138
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:52,499
because if you train this person

2139
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,899
and then they produce a lot of money for you,

2140
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:56,042
you get that money.

2141
01:19:57,149 --> 01:20:00,119
And those slaves would sometimes be given an incentive

2142
01:20:00,119 --> 01:20:02,578
to work hard where they could...

2143
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:03,778
And this is just sort of an agreement

2144
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:05,008
between the master and the slave,

2145
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:07,920
if they earned a certain amount of money,

2146
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,390
X amount of money,

2147
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:12,510
they could then buy their own freedom from the master.

2148
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,370
So this was your incentive to work harder

2149
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:16,258
if you were trained, let's say, as a doctor,

2150
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,130
I worked really hard,

2151
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,770
I can buy myself out of slavery.

2152
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:23,103
Or a lot of masters would free their slaves in their wills.

2153
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,297
So when they died, they would say,

2154
01:20:25,296 --> 01:20:28,438
"I manumit this slave and that slave."

2155
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:31,588
So it was a weird institution in that it was,

2156
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:33,290
elements were just as horrible

2157
01:20:33,289 --> 01:20:34,799
as what we think of as slavery,

2158
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,360
and just as exploitative.

2159
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:38,698
And it, like I say, the overall notion of slavery

2160
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:41,848
is intensely dehumanizing.

2161
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:45,240
But yet there was this wide range of types of slaves.

2162
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:47,489
And the odd thing is, in the city of Rome,

2163
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:49,768
many of the worst jobs,

2164
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,179
so if you're, you know,

2165
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,930
just a laborer hauling crap around,

2166
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:54,840
you know, at the docks

2167
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,340
or, you know, things like that,

2168
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,770
you might well be a free person

2169
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,979
and a slave would hold a skilled job.

2170
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:04,858
And that seems a little strange or counterintuitive to us,

2171
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:07,468
but you see how in the Roman economy,

2172
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:08,820
it sort of works.

2173
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:10,258
- And that could be one of the things

2174
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:11,1000
that would be surprising to us

2175
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,560
coming from the modern day to the ancient world

2176
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,009
is just the number of slaves.

2177
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:19,050
So you mentioned one of the things we don't think about

2178
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:21,657
is that most of the people are farmers.

2179
01:21:21,657 --> 01:21:22,490
- Yeah. - And then the other thing

2180
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:24,569
is just the number of slaves.

2181
01:21:24,569 --> 01:21:25,469
- And there's a big debate.

2182
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:27,389
How many slaves were there?

2183
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,069
You know, what percentage of the populace,

2184
01:21:29,069 --> 01:21:30,569
let's say, in the city of Rome were slaves?

2185
01:21:30,569 --> 01:21:33,899
And this is something historians like to argue about a lot.

2186
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:35,759
And we keep coming back to this theme of, you know,

2187
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,260
sometimes it's the little things

2188
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,520
that illustrates stuff well.

2189
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,580
And for slaves, the one that always gets me

2190
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:42,929
is some slaves,

2191
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,389
and these would be sort of the more abused slaves,

2192
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:48,630
they would literally put little bronze collars on them

2193
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:52,830
with a tag that said, you know, "Hi, my name is Felix.

2194
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:54,569
I'm the slave of so-and-so.

2195
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:55,619
I've run away.

2196
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,519
If you catch me,

2197
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,230
return me to the temple of so-and-so

2198
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:59,428
and you'll get a reward."

2199
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,170
So it's a dog tag, right?

2200
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,640
Except this is a human being.

2201
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,140
And you can see these in museums.

2202
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:05,430
I mean, you can go to a museum today

2203
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:08,550
and see this little bronze collar with a tag on it

2204
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:10,199
that's talking about a human being

2205
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:13,139
as if they're this kind of animal that's run away.

2206
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,436
And this is very telling too,

2207
01:22:14,435 --> 01:22:15,539
we're talking about Roman law.

2208
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:16,649
Under Roman law,

2209
01:22:16,649 --> 01:22:19,649
technically, when a slave runs away,

2210
01:22:19,649 --> 01:22:23,099
the crime that he's committing is theft

2211
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:27,779
because he's stolen himself from his master.

2212
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:30,569
So again, it's this very dehumanizing view of it.

2213
01:22:30,569 --> 01:22:32,429
- And just a reminder

2214
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:34,650
to people in America thinking about this,

2215
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:39,089
we have a certain view and picture to what slavery is,

2216
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:42,719
a reminder that all of human history,

2217
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,800
most of human history has had slaves

2218
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,250
of all colors, of all religions.

2219
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:54,509
That's within us to select a group of people,

2220
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,070
calling the other,

2221
01:22:56,069 --> 01:22:59,669
use them as objects, abuse them.

2222
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,503
And I would say,

2223
01:23:00,502 --> 01:23:03,538
as a person who believes the line between good and evil

2224
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:05,759
runs to the heart of every man,

2225
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,280
all of us, every person listening to this,

2226
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:12,359
is capable of being owner of a slave

2227
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:13,709
if they're put in the position.

2228
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,510
Of capable of hating the other,

2229
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:16,832
of forming the other,

2230
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:19,917
of othering other people.

2231
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:21,513
And we should be very careful,

2232
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:24,958
to look ourselves in the mirror

2233
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,670
and remind ourselves that we're human.

2234
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,140
It's easy to kind of think, okay,

2235
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,059
well, there's these slaves

2236
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:31,106
and slave owners through history,

2237
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,089
and I would've never been one of those.

2238
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:38,090
But just like as we would be farmers,

2239
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:39,900
we could be both.

2240
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:41,358
If we went back into history,

2241
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:43,439
we could be both slaves and slave owners,

2242
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:45,809
and all of those are humans.

2243
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:46,800
- I mean, just to build on that,

2244
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,600
I'd say the othering of others

2245
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,050
is a morally corrosive thing to do.

2246
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:52,883
- Yeah.

2247
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:56,698
So this fascinating transition

2248
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:59,279
between the republic to the empire,

2249
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:00,269
can we talk about that?

2250
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,939
How does the republic fall?

2251
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:04,066
- Oh, boy. (Gregory laughing)

2252
01:24:04,068 --> 01:24:04,901
Okay, so,

2253
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,999
the Roman Republic, on the one hand,

2254
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,609
is incredibly successful, right?

2255
01:24:11,609 --> 01:24:13,079
In a short period of time,

2256
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:14,669
is it expanded wildly,

2257
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,710
it's conquered the Mediterranean world,

2258
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:19,049
it's gained tons of wealth.

2259
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:23,800
The contradiction here is that Rome's very success

2260
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:28,288
has made almost every group within Roman society

2261
01:24:28,289 --> 01:24:32,369
deeply unhappy and boiling with resentment.

2262
01:24:32,369 --> 01:24:33,808
So this is the contradiction.

2263
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,819
Enormous success on the surface,

2264
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:37,379
you end up with this boiling pot

2265
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,269
of resentment and unhappiness.

2266
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:40,499
So let's break this down.

2267
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,030
Who's unhappy?

2268
01:24:42,029 --> 01:24:45,658
Well, the people fighting Rome's wars.

2269
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:47,609
The common farmers who went off to fight.

2270
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:48,659
They joined the army,

2271
01:24:48,659 --> 01:24:49,492
they went and fought,

2272
01:24:49,493 --> 01:24:50,490
they've come back,

2273
01:24:50,489 --> 01:24:51,989
they've seen Rome get wealthy,

2274
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:54,029
they've seen their generals get wealthy,

2275
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:55,349
they've conquered all these areas,

2276
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:57,479
all this money and stuff is going back to Rome,

2277
01:24:57,479 --> 01:24:59,128
but when they're discharged from the army,

2278
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,720
they don't get that much.

2279
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,553
So they feel like,

2280
01:25:01,552 --> 01:25:03,058
"I spent the best years of my life

2281
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,530
fighting for my country.

2282
01:25:04,529 --> 01:25:05,758
I deserve a reward.

2283
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,989
I haven't gotten it."

2284
01:25:06,989 --> 01:25:08,158
So you have a lot of veterans

2285
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:11,009
who are now unemployed or underemployed.

2286
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,710
Many of them have sold their small family farms

2287
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:15,149
when they went off to join the army,

2288
01:25:15,149 --> 01:25:16,739
and now they don't have them.

2289
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:19,408
So that group's unhappy, the veterans.

2290
01:25:19,409 --> 01:25:23,489
You have the aristocrats,

2291
01:25:23,489 --> 01:25:24,359
who, on the surface,

2292
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:25,192
the ones who are doing well.

2293
01:25:25,193 --> 01:25:28,020
They're the politicians and the generals.

2294
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,399
But as time goes on,

2295
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:31,754
the ones who get the plum appointments,

2296
01:25:31,755 --> 01:25:33,089
who get the good generalships,

2297
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:35,730
starts coming from a smaller and smaller subset

2298
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:36,928
of the aristocrats.

2299
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:40,019
The Scipio and their friends start to dominate.

2300
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,810
So you end up where most of the aristocratic class

2301
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,580
is feeling, "Hey, I'm left out.

2302
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:46,498
I didn't get what I deserved."

2303
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,629
What about the half citizens and the allies?

2304
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:50,940
The Italians who have fought for Rome, who stayed loyal.

2305
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:51,899
When Hannibal invaded,

2306
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:54,149
they didn't go over to his side.

2307
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,129
Well, they feel, rightfully,

2308
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,720
we stayed loyal to Rome,

2309
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,560
we fought for them,

2310
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,729
we deserve our reward,

2311
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:01,199
we should be full citizens.

2312
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,789
But the Romans are traditional,

2313
01:26:02,789 --> 01:26:03,779
they're conservative,

2314
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:04,918
they don't like change,

2315
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,452
they don't give them that.

2316
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,120
What about all the slaves?

2317
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:10,859
Well, they've conquered all these foreigners,

2318
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:11,692
they've sold them,

2319
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:14,339
now, many of them are working these plantations,

2320
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,320
big plantations owned by rich people

2321
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:18,539
that used to be little family farms,

2322
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:20,759
the slaves are obviously unhappy.

2323
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,290
So you end up with a society

2324
01:26:22,289 --> 01:26:25,979
where it's incredibly successful by about a hundred BC

2325
01:26:25,979 --> 01:26:28,438
but almost every group that composes it

2326
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:30,809
feels like "I haven't shared

2327
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:32,280
in the benefits of what's happened"

2328
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:34,408
or "I've been exploited by it."

2329
01:26:34,409 --> 01:26:36,868
So they all end up intensely unhappy.

2330
01:26:36,869 --> 01:26:38,579
And the next a hundred year period,

2331
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:40,918
from 133 to 31 BC,

2332
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,390
is called the late Roman Republic,

2333
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:46,409
and it's a time of nearly constant internal strife,

2334
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:50,372
ultimately culminating in multiple rounds of civil war.

2335
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:54,629
So Roman society literally breaks apart,

2336
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:56,160
turns on itself,

2337
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,109
and goes to war with itself

2338
01:26:58,109 --> 01:27:01,859
over not equitably sharing the benefits

2339
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:03,868
of conquest and of empire.

2340
01:27:03,869 --> 01:27:06,418
So it's a lesson about not sharing

2341
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,670
the benefits of something in a society,

2342
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:11,190
but concentrating it in one little group.

2343
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:12,868
And the other thing that happens is,

2344
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:14,669
among the aristocrats,

2345
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,520
they start to get more and more ambitious.

2346
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,689
So in the past,

2347
01:27:18,689 --> 01:27:20,128
there was a lot of ideology

2348
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,679
of the state is more important than the person.

2349
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,119
If you were a little Roman kid,

2350
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:26,609
you would've been told these stories of Roman heroes.

2351
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:28,618
And they're all about self-sacrifice,

2352
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:30,389
putting the state before you,

2353
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:31,619
about modesty,

2354
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:33,748
about these sort of, you know, values.

2355
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,159
Well, by the late republic,

2356
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:38,990
you have a succession of strong men.

2357
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,139
And it is a chain.

2358
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,769
So it goes, you know, Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Julius Caesar,

2359
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:47,069
where each one pushes the boundaries

2360
01:27:47,069 --> 01:27:49,169
of the Roman Republic a little bit,

2361
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:52,529
pushes at the structures of the institutions,

2362
01:27:52,529 --> 01:27:53,609
the republic,

2363
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:56,068
and they're motivated by personal gain.

2364
01:27:56,069 --> 01:27:59,218
They're putting themselves above the state.

2365
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,270
So at the same time,

2366
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:03,089
you have lots of groups unhappy in society,

2367
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,099
and you get these strong men

2368
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,289
who are now undermining the institutions,

2369
01:28:07,289 --> 01:28:10,858
chipping away at the things that have been shared,

2370
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:13,439
things holding the state together,

2371
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:14,489
and in the end,

2372
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,868
they just become so ambitious,

2373
01:28:15,869 --> 01:28:18,119
they're like, "I don't care about the state.

2374
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:21,359
I'm gonna try and make myself ruler of Rome."

2375
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:22,289
So I mean,

2376
01:28:22,289 --> 01:28:24,688
this is gonna culminate obviously in Julius Caesar

2377
01:28:24,689 --> 01:28:27,959
who does succeed in making himself dictator

2378
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,359
for life of the Roman Republic,

2379
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:32,579
which is tantamount to king,

2380
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:34,559
and he gets assassinated for it.

2381
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,859
But he's the end point of this progression of people

2382
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:40,738
who really undermine the institutions,

2383
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:41,572
the republic,

2384
01:28:41,573 --> 01:28:43,260
through their own personal greed.

2385
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,840
- So the resentment boils and boils and boils,

2386
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,1000
and there's this person that puts themselves above-

2387
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:48,870
- And they exploit it.

2388
01:28:48,869 --> 01:28:50,819
They're demagogues. They exploit it.

2389
01:28:50,819 --> 01:28:53,048
- But Caesar puts himself above the state

2390
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:58,320
and that, I guess, the Roman people also hate.

2391
01:28:58,319 --> 01:28:59,609
- Well, I mean, it's a love-hate

2392
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:01,618
because Caesar is very successful

2393
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:03,479
at playing to the Roman people.

2394
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:06,306
So he becomes their hero where he says, you know,

2395
01:29:06,306 --> 01:29:08,999
"I'll be your champion against the state

2396
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,237
who doesn't care about you."

2397
01:29:10,237 --> 01:29:12,240
You know? So Caesar will do things

2398
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:15,058
where he'll put on big shows for the people.

2399
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,259
And it's cynical.

2400
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:19,769
I mean, he's doing this to further his own political power,

2401
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:24,090
but he's presenting himself as a populist, in essence,

2402
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:26,883
even though he aspires to be a dictator, right?

2403
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:30,238
But it's a way of winning the people's support,

2404
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,918
because that's a tool for him

2405
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,080
in his struggle with other aristocrats.

2406
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:37,199
- So a dictator in populist clothing.

2407
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:38,032
- Yes.

2408
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,040
- So, but he gets- - When convenient.

2409
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:43,201
Other times, he'll play to the aristocracy.

2410
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:47,068
- And when he gets assassinated,

2411
01:29:47,069 --> 01:29:50,609
another civil war explodes.

2412
01:29:50,609 --> 01:29:51,778
- That's an interesting moment

2413
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:54,238
because all these things have been leading up to Caesar,

2414
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,769
and it really is a chain of men.

2415
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:57,540
So it starts with this guy, Marius,

2416
01:29:57,539 --> 01:30:01,469
who is one of the first to start making armies loyal to him

2417
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:03,330
rather than to the state.

2418
01:30:03,329 --> 01:30:05,218
That's a step in the wrong direction, right?

2419
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,229
The army should be loyal to the state,

2420
01:30:07,229 --> 01:30:08,519
not to an individual general.

2421
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,110
They shouldn't look for him to rewards.

2422
01:30:10,109 --> 01:30:11,609
Mariuus kind of breaks that,

2423
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:12,899
makes a precedent.

2424
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:15,448
One of his proteges is a guy named Sulla.

2425
01:30:15,449 --> 01:30:16,648
Sulla comes along

2426
01:30:16,649 --> 01:30:19,499
and he ends up marching on Rome with his army

2427
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,179
and taking it over.

2428
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:22,500
And he says, "Well, I'm just doing it

2429
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,580
for the good of the state."

2430
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:24,839
But that's another precedent.

2431
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,139
Now, you've had someone attacking their own capital city,

2432
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:31,649
even if they say they're doing it for the right reasons.

2433
01:30:31,649 --> 01:30:33,239
Then Pompey comes along.

2434
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:35,669
And Pompey just breaks all kinds of things.

2435
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,390
He starts holding offices when he's too young to do so.

2436
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:43,050
He raises personal armies from his own wealth.

2437
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,489
He disobeys commands,

2438
01:30:44,489 --> 01:30:45,779
he manipulates commands,

2439
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:47,218
he does all kinds of stuff.

2440
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,120
But in the end,

2441
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:51,779
he sides with the Senate, when sort of forced.

2442
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:53,399
And finally, Caesar comes along,

2443
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:56,189
and Caesar's just shamelessly, "No, it's about me.

2444
01:30:56,189 --> 01:30:57,388
I'm gonna push it."

2445
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:59,939
And he is the one who wins a civil war

2446
01:30:59,939 --> 01:31:01,828
against the state and Pompey,

2447
01:31:01,829 --> 01:31:03,006
takes over Rome, and says,

2448
01:31:03,006 --> 01:31:05,308
"Now, I'm gonna be dictator."

2449
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:08,250
And dictator is a traditional office in the Roman state,

2450
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,540
but dictators were limited

2451
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:11,759
to no more than six months in power.

2452
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,909
And Caesar says, "Well, I'll be dictator for life,"

2453
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:16,048
which, of course, is king,

2454
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,429
he gets killed for it.

2455
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:22,430
So Caesar succeeded in taking over the state as one man,

2456
01:31:23,369 --> 01:31:25,679
but he couldn't solve the problem:

2457
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,829
how do you rule Rome as one person

2458
01:31:28,829 --> 01:31:32,759
and not get killed for looking like a king?

2459
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:33,959
That's the dilemma,

2460
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,239
the riddle that Caesar leaves behind him.

2461
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,349
He did it.

2462
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:39,390
He sees power as one guy,

2463
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:41,279
but how do you stay alive?

2464
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:42,448
How do you come up with something

2465
01:31:42,449 --> 01:31:43,979
that the people will accept?

2466
01:31:43,979 --> 01:31:45,959
And Caesar did some other things which were bad.

2467
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,040
He was arrogant.

2468
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:51,058
He didn't even pretend that the Senate were his equals.

2469
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:53,280
He just kind of, you know, railroaded them around.

2470
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:54,938
He didn't respect them.

2471
01:31:54,939 --> 01:31:56,639
You know, he named a month after himself.

2472
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,649
July, Julius.

2473
01:31:58,649 --> 01:32:00,629
He did egotistical things.

2474
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:02,580
So that pissed people off.

2475
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:03,659
They didn't like it.

2476
01:32:03,659 --> 01:32:05,038
And when Caesar dies,

2477
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:06,958
it's this interesting moment.

2478
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,540
The Republic is sort of dead by then.

2479
01:32:09,539 --> 01:32:11,369
You're gonna have a hard time reviving it.

2480
01:32:11,369 --> 01:32:13,378
You've broken too many precedents.

2481
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,940
But there's a power vacuum now.

2482
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:17,999
Caesar's gone, what's gonna happen next?

2483
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,649
And you have a whole group of people

2484
01:32:19,649 --> 01:32:21,239
who wanna be the next Caesar.

2485
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:23,759
So the most obvious is Mark Antony,

2486
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,350
who is Caesar's right-hand man,

2487
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,183
his lieutenant.

2488
01:32:26,182 --> 01:32:28,738
He's a very good general, he's very charismatic.

2489
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:30,418
Everybody kind of expects Mark Antony

2490
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,670
to just become the next Caesar.

2491
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:34,710
But there's also another of Caesar's lieutenants,

2492
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:36,750
a guy named Lepidus, sort of like Antony,

2493
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,490
but not quite as great as him.

2494
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:39,989
There's the Senate itself,

2495
01:32:39,989 --> 01:32:41,638
which wants to reassert its power,

2496
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,249
kind of become the dominant force in Rome again.

2497
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:47,040
There's the assassins who killed Caesar.

2498
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:49,349
Led by Brutus and another guy Cassius,

2499
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:51,419
they now want to seize control.

2500
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,299
And finally, there's a really weird dark horse candidate

2501
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,800
to fill this power vacuum,

2502
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,880
and that's Julius Caesar's grand nephew,

2503
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:04,110
who, at the time, is a 17-year-old kid named Octavian.

2504
01:33:04,109 --> 01:33:05,699
Who cares? He's nobody.

2505
01:33:05,699 --> 01:33:07,348
Absolutely nobody.

2506
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:10,800
But when Caesar's will is opened after his death,

2507
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,079
so posthumously read,

2508
01:33:13,079 --> 01:33:16,139
in his will, Caesar posthumously,

2509
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,549
and this is a little weird,

2510
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:21,300
posthumously adopts Octavian as his son.

2511
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,340
Now, again, who cares?

2512
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:24,450
Antony gets the troops,

2513
01:33:24,449 --> 01:33:25,409
Antony gets the money,

2514
01:33:25,409 --> 01:33:26,788
the other people get everything.

2515
01:33:26,789 --> 01:33:28,289
What does Octavian get?

2516
01:33:28,289 --> 01:33:30,418
He gets to now rename himself

2517
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:33,420
Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus.

2518
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,649
Who cares?

2519
01:33:34,649 --> 01:33:36,928
Well, around the Mediterranean,

2520
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:40,860
there's about 12 legions full of hardened soldiers

2521
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:42,868
who are just kind of used to following

2522
01:33:42,869 --> 01:33:46,018
a guy named Gaius Julius Caesar.

2523
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,390
And even though it's not quite logical,

2524
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:49,320
this 18-year-old,

2525
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:50,728
he's now 18-year-old kid,

2526
01:33:50,729 --> 01:33:53,128
inherits an army overnight.

2527
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:56,159
So he becomes a player in this game for power.

2528
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,768
And the next 30, 40 years

2529
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:01,859
is gonna be those groups all vying with one another.

2530
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:03,839
There's another candidate too, Pompey's son.

2531
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,729
Pompey was Caesar's great rival.

2532
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:06,749
He has a couple sons,

2533
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,240
and one of them, a guy named Sextus Pompey,

2534
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:12,538
basically becomes a warlord who seizes control of Sicily,

2535
01:34:12,539 --> 01:34:14,218
one of the richest provinces,

2536
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:15,449
has a whole navy.

2537
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:18,719
He's vying to be one of these successors too.

2538
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,710
So for the next 40 years,

2539
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:22,680
it's, as you said, another civil war

2540
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,840
to see which guy emerges.

2541
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,740
Is it gonna be the Senate?

2542
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:26,849
Is it gonna be the assassins?

2543
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:27,960
Is it gonna be an Antony?

2544
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:28,793
Is it gonna be Lepidus?

2545
01:34:28,792 --> 01:34:29,878
Is it gonna be Sextus Pompey?

2546
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,319
Is it gonna be Octavian?

2547
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:33,769
- So now, looking back at all that history,

2548
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,970
it just feels like history turns on

2549
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:37,889
so many interesting accidents

2550
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:41,490
because Octavian, later in named Augustus,

2551
01:34:41,489 --> 01:34:43,202
has turned out to be actually,

2552
01:34:44,909 --> 01:34:46,288
depends how you define good,

2553
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:49,949
but a good king/emperor,

2554
01:34:49,949 --> 01:34:52,799
different than Caesar in terms of humility,

2555
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,273
at least being able to play.

2556
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,483
Not to piss off everybody,

2557
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:01,140
but like it could have been so many other people.

2558
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:03,732
That could have been the fall of Rome.

2559
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,299
So like, it's a fascinating little turn of history.

2560
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,880
Maybe Caesar saw something in this individual.

2561
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,279
It's not an accident that he was in the will.

2562
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:12,658
- Yeah, it's, I mean,

2563
01:35:12,659 --> 01:35:15,359
Caesar clearly did see something in him.

2564
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:18,359
And Octavian, I mean, to cut to the end,

2565
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:20,638
is the one who emerges from all that as the victor.

2566
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,960
We can talk about how he does it,

2567
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,180
but he's the one who sort of ends up

2568
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:26,040
in the same position as Caesar.

2569
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:27,208
It takes him 30 years,

2570
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:28,680
but he defeats all the foes.

2571
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,1000
He's the sole guy,

2572
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,220
he now faces Caesar's riddle:

2573
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,050
How do you rule Rome as one guy

2574
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:35,340
and not get killed?

2575
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:37,830
And Octavian, what makes him stand out

2576
01:35:37,829 --> 01:35:40,409
and what makes him fascinating to me

2577
01:35:40,409 --> 01:35:43,139
is he wasn't a good general.

2578
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:44,460
In fact, he was a terrible general.

2579
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:47,219
He lost almost every battle he commanded.

2580
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:50,910
But what he is is he's politically savvy

2581
01:35:50,909 --> 01:35:53,429
and he's very good at what today we would call

2582
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:55,680
manipulation of your public image

2583
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,390
and propaganda.

2584
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:01,050
So he basically defeats Mark Antony, partially,

2585
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:03,929
by waging a propaganda war against him.

2586
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:07,260
I mean, Antony starts out as a legitimate rival,

2587
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,570
and there are two Romans vying for power,

2588
01:36:09,569 --> 01:36:12,749
at the end of this war, propaganda war,

2589
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:15,120
Octavian has managed to portray Antony

2590
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,728
as a foreign aggressor

2591
01:36:17,729 --> 01:36:20,449
allied with an enemy king or queen,

2592
01:36:20,449 --> 01:36:22,229
in this case, Cleopatra,

2593
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:24,659
and who is an official enemy of the Roman state,

2594
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:26,429
and that's all propaganda.

2595
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:28,559
So he takes what's a civil war

2596
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,680
and makes it look like a war against a foreign enemy.

2597
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:35,430
And when Octavian becomes the sole ruler,

2598
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:37,410
he looks at what Caesar did wrong

2599
01:36:37,409 --> 01:36:41,069
and he very carefully avoids the same mistakes.

2600
01:36:41,069 --> 01:36:43,589
So the first thing is just how he lives his life.

2601
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:44,729
He's very modest.

2602
01:36:44,729 --> 01:36:47,338
He lives in an ordinary house like other aristocrats.

2603
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,830
He wears just a plain toga, nothing fancy.

2604
01:36:49,829 --> 01:36:51,478
He's respectful to the Senate.

2605
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:52,858
He treats them with respect.

2606
01:36:52,859 --> 01:36:54,719
He eats simple foods.

2607
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:58,349
I mean, he's someone who cared about the reality of power,

2608
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:00,570
not the external trappings.

2609
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:01,859
Clearly, there's some rulers

2610
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:03,809
who love "I want to dress in fancy clothes.

2611
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:05,819
I want to be surrounded by gold. Everything.

2612
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:07,559
This is what makes me feel good."

2613
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,640
Octavian is the opposite.

2614
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,289
He doesn't care about any of that.

2615
01:37:10,289 --> 01:37:12,449
He wants real power.

2616
01:37:12,449 --> 01:37:13,588
And then the other thing is,

2617
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:16,500
how is he gonna rule Rome without looking like a king?

2618
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,689
And his solution to this is brilliant.

2619
01:37:18,689 --> 01:37:23,309
He basically pretends to resign from all his public offices.

2620
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:24,630
And not pretends, he does.

2621
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:27,150
So he holds no official office.

2622
01:37:27,149 --> 01:37:29,338
But what he does is he manipulates

2623
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:32,130
so that the Roman Senate votes him

2624
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:35,310
the powers of the key Roman offices,

2625
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:37,530
but not the office itself.

2626
01:37:37,529 --> 01:37:40,259
So the highest office in the Roman state is the consul.

2627
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,179
Consuls have the power to command armies,

2628
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,530
do all sorts of things,

2629
01:37:43,529 --> 01:37:44,879
run meetings of the Senate.

2630
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:48,770
Octavian gets voted the powers of a consul.

2631
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:50,219
So he can command armies,

2632
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,810
control meetings of the Senate, do all this,

2633
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:55,290
but he's not one of the two consuls elected for every year.

2634
01:37:55,289 --> 01:37:56,819
So he's just kind of floating

2635
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:01,049
or drifting off to the side of the Roman government.

2636
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,610
He gets the power of a tribune,

2637
01:38:02,609 --> 01:38:04,109
which has all sorts of powers.

2638
01:38:04,109 --> 01:38:05,548
He can veto anything he wants,

2639
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:08,759
but he's not one of the tribunes elected for any one year.

2640
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,130
So the state, the republic,

2641
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:12,930
appears to continue as it always has.

2642
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:14,520
Each year, they hold the same elections,

2643
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,020
they elect the same number of people,

2644
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:18,450
notionally, those people are in charge.

2645
01:38:18,449 --> 01:38:20,039
But floating off to the side,

2646
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:21,659
you have this guy, Octavian,

2647
01:38:21,659 --> 01:38:23,038
who has equivalent power,

2648
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:26,219
not just to any one magistrate or official,

2649
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:27,930
but to all of them.

2650
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:30,216
So any moment, he can just sort of pop up and say,

2651
01:38:30,216 --> 01:38:31,649
"No, let's not do this.

2652
01:38:31,649 --> 01:38:33,209
Let's do something else."

2653
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:36,390
And he also keeps the army under his personal control.

2654
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:37,890
- Isn't this a fascinating story?

2655
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:39,870
Like what do you think is the psychology

2656
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:40,766
of Augustus, of Octavian?

2657
01:38:40,766 --> 01:38:43,258
- Yeah, and he later changed his name to Augustus

2658
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,461
when he sort of becomes first emperor.

2659
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:45,930
And the other thing he does is he hides his power

2660
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,760
behind all these different names.

2661
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,710
So, you know, Caesar called himself

2662
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:50,820
dictator for life, right?

2663
01:38:50,819 --> 01:38:52,198
So everybody knew what he was.

2664
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:54,019
Octavian, we even have a source that talks about it,

2665
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,076
he says he wondered what to call himself.

2666
01:38:56,077 --> 01:38:57,750
"Do I call myself king? No, can't do that.

2667
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:59,700
Dictator for life? No way.

2668
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,319
Maybe I'll call myself Romulus?"

2669
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:02,152
That was the founder of Rome.

2670
01:39:02,153 --> 01:39:03,990
"No, no. Romulus was a king."

2671
01:39:03,989 --> 01:39:05,759
And finally, his solution is,

2672
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,610
he takes a bunch of titles,

2673
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,681
which are all ambiguous,

2674
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,760
and no one of them sounds that impressive,

2675
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,560
but collectively, they are.

2676
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,609
So for example, one of the titles he gets is Augustus,

2677
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:22,498
which is something tied to Roman religion.

2678
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,509
Something that is Augustus in Latin

2679
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:26,429
has two possible meanings.

2680
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:29,070
One is, someone who is Augustus

2681
01:39:29,069 --> 01:39:30,659
is very pious.

2682
01:39:30,659 --> 01:39:32,308
They respect the gods deeply.

2683
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:34,199
Well, that sounds nice, doesn't it?

2684
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:35,032
Well, on the other hand,

2685
01:39:35,033 --> 01:39:36,569
an alternative meaning for Augustus

2686
01:39:36,569 --> 01:39:38,581
is something that is itself divine.

2687
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:42,900
So is he just a deeply religious pious person

2688
01:39:42,899 --> 01:39:44,968
or is he himself sacred?

2689
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:46,262
There's that ambiguity.

2690
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:49,110
He calls himself princeps,

2691
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:51,778
which means first citizen.

2692
01:39:51,779 --> 01:39:54,359
Okay, what the hell does that mean?

2693
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:56,459
Am I a citizen just like everybody else

2694
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,500
or am I the first citizen,

2695
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,049
which means I'm superior to all the others?

2696
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:03,809
So every title he takes has this weird ambiguity.

2697
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:06,120
He calls himself imperator,

2698
01:40:06,119 --> 01:40:07,829
which is traditionally something

2699
01:40:07,829 --> 01:40:10,679
that soldiers shout at a victorious general

2700
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,730
who's won a battle.

2701
01:40:11,729 --> 01:40:14,068
And now he takes this as a permanent title,

2702
01:40:14,069 --> 01:40:16,678
so it implies he's a good general.

2703
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,1000
And by the way, it's from imperator

2704
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,270
that we get the word emperor, an empire.

2705
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:23,609
So originally, it's a military title,

2706
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:25,738
a spontaneous military acclimation.

2707
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:28,319
- It's just fascinating that he figured out a way

2708
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:31,138
through public image, through branding

2709
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:36,140
to gain power, maintain power,

2710
01:40:36,569 --> 01:40:40,366
and still pacify the boiling turmoil

2711
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:44,789
that led to the civil wars. - Yeah.

2712
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,338
Well, two things, I think, work in his favor as well.

2713
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:51,060
One is he brings peace and stability.

2714
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:53,550
So by this point, the Romans have experienced

2715
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:58,139
a hundred years, almost, of civil war and chaos.

2716
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:00,660
So at that point, you know, your family,

2717
01:41:00,659 --> 01:41:02,998
maybe you've had family members die in these wars,

2718
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,110
have been proscribed,

2719
01:41:04,109 --> 01:41:05,788
your property has been confiscated,

2720
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:06,749
who knows what.

2721
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:09,779
And here's a guy who brings peace and stability

2722
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:12,269
and doesn't seem oppressive or cruel or whatever.

2723
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:13,890
So you're like, "Okay, fine.

2724
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:14,723
I don't care.

2725
01:41:14,722 --> 01:41:16,349
Maybe he's killed the republic,

2726
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:19,320
but at least we're not dying in the streets anymore."

2727
01:41:19,319 --> 01:41:20,998
So that's a big thing he does.

2728
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,889
And secondly,

2729
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:24,930
even though Augustus always seemed kind of sickly,

2730
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:28,349
his constitution, he lives forever.

2731
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:30,570
He rules for like 50 years.

2732
01:41:30,569 --> 01:41:33,328
And by the time he dies,

2733
01:41:33,329 --> 01:41:36,148
there's no one, literally, almost left alive

2734
01:41:36,149 --> 01:41:37,649
who can remember the republic.

2735
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:41,340
So at that point, by the time he dies,

2736
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,739
this is the only system we know.

2737
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:47,549
- That's another just fascinating accident of history,

2738
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:50,759
'cause as we talked about with Alexander the Great,

2739
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:54,482
who knows if he lived for another 40 years?

2740
01:41:56,503 --> 01:42:00,028
If over time, the people that hate the new thing die off

2741
01:42:00,029 --> 01:42:03,032
and then their sons come into power,

2742
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:05,458
that could be a very different story

2743
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:06,712
and maybe we would be talking about Greek Empire.

2744
01:42:06,712 --> 01:42:07,589
- Yeah, that's a fluke of fate,

2745
01:42:07,590 --> 01:42:09,960
but it's hugely influential on history.

2746
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,928
- You mentioned Cleopatra.

2747
01:42:11,927 --> 01:42:12,929
If we go back to that,

2748
01:42:12,930 --> 01:42:14,910
what role did she play?

2749
01:42:14,909 --> 01:42:17,308
Another fascinating human being.

2750
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:19,110
- Cleopatra is interesting.

2751
01:42:19,109 --> 01:42:22,318
I mean, she was a direct descendant

2752
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:24,809
of one of Alexander the Great's generals,

2753
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:25,890
Ptolemy.

2754
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:28,019
When Alexander's empire had broken up,

2755
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:29,159
Ptolemy, this general,

2756
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:30,719
had seized control of Egypt,

2757
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,129
made it his kingdom.

2758
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:34,920
And she, 10 generations later,

2759
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:38,100
is a descendant of this Macedonian general.

2760
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:41,939
So Egypt had been ruled by, in essence, foreigners,

2761
01:42:41,939 --> 01:42:44,338
these Macedonian dynasty of kings,

2762
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,610
and often, they literally were ruled by the same dynasty

2763
01:42:47,609 --> 01:42:50,789
'cause they had a habit of marrying brothers to sisters,

2764
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:52,139
and Cleopatra is, in fact,

2765
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:54,273
originally married to her younger brother.

2766
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,780
But despite that,

2767
01:42:57,779 --> 01:43:01,801
she seems to have intensely identified with Egypt.

2768
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:04,620
In fact, she seems to have been the first one

2769
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:06,359
of all these Ptolemy kings

2770
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:08,809
who actually bothered to learn to speak Egyptian.

2771
01:43:09,689 --> 01:43:13,799
So she seemed to really have cared about Egypt as well.

2772
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,429
And she was clearly very smart, very clever.

2773
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:20,639
And so she's living at a time

2774
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:21,809
during the late republic,

2775
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:23,790
when Rome is having all these civil wars,

2776
01:43:23,789 --> 01:43:27,989
and Egypt is really the last big, independent kingdom left

2777
01:43:27,989 --> 01:43:29,849
around the shores of the Mediterranean.

2778
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:32,519
Everything else has been conquered by Rome.

2779
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,520
So she is in this very precarious position

2780
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,160
where clearly she wants to maintain Egyptian independence,

2781
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:41,549
but Rome is this juggernaut that's rolling over everything.

2782
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:44,040
And she ends up meeting Julius Caesar

2783
01:43:44,039 --> 01:43:47,219
when Caesar comes to Egypt chasing Pompey,

2784
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,180
his great rival.

2785
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,230
After he defeats Pompey,

2786
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:50,458
Pompey runs to Egypt,

2787
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:52,200
thinking he'll sanctuary there,

2788
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:54,449
and the Egyptians kill him and chop off his head.

2789
01:43:54,449 --> 01:43:55,499
And when Caesar lands,

2790
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:58,166
they hand it to him and say, "Here, have a present."

2791
01:43:59,909 --> 01:44:01,078
And she, of course, famously ends up

2792
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:02,939
having a love affair with Caesar.

2793
01:44:02,939 --> 01:44:05,309
Was that a genuine love

2794
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:06,719
or was she just sort of, you know,

2795
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:07,580
using this as a way

2796
01:44:07,579 --> 01:44:09,478
to try and keep Egypt independent,

2797
01:44:09,479 --> 01:44:10,888
to give it some status?

2798
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:12,510
We don't know.

2799
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:14,853
After she does have several kids with Caesar,

2800
01:44:15,689 --> 01:44:17,608
after Caesar's assassinated,

2801
01:44:17,609 --> 01:44:20,459
and the Roman world is having another civil war

2802
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,260
between Octavian and Mark Antony,

2803
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:24,480
Mark Antony is basing himself in the east,

2804
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:25,678
he meets Cleopatra

2805
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:28,019
and he has a big love affair with her.

2806
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:29,943
And this one seems pretty genuine.

2807
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,670
I mean, Antony and Cleopatra,

2808
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:34,170
there's a lot of stories about them

2809
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:35,579
kind of partying together.

2810
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:37,858
They like to sort of cosplay

2811
01:44:37,859 --> 01:44:40,379
and dress up as different gods.

2812
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:43,529
So Cleopatra would dress up as the goddess Isis

2813
01:44:43,529 --> 01:44:44,999
and Antony would dress up

2814
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,100
as the god Dionysus in a leopard skin,

2815
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,289
and they have these big parties and stuff.

2816
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:53,128
And they end up, together, fighting against Octavian.

2817
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:56,670
And in the end, they're defeated by Octavian.

2818
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:59,790
And Antony commits suicide,

2819
01:44:59,789 --> 01:45:03,269
Cleopatra, there's differing accounts of her death.

2820
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:05,189
She may have also killed herself

2821
01:45:05,189 --> 01:45:08,039
or she may actually have been killed by Octavian

2822
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:09,589
to just get her out of the way.

2823
01:45:10,439 --> 01:45:11,638
But she's an interesting figure

2824
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,700
because she was clearly a very smart woman

2825
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:18,659
who managed to keep Egypt alive as an independent state.

2826
01:45:18,659 --> 01:45:21,149
She seemed to have actually cared about Egypt,

2827
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:23,038
and identified with it,

2828
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:25,446
and succeeded at a time with all these famous people,

2829
01:45:25,447 --> 01:45:28,350
you know, in being a real kind of mover and shaker

2830
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:30,359
and a force in events.

2831
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:33,028
- I mean, she's probably one of the most influential women

2832
01:45:33,029 --> 01:45:34,321
in human history.

2833
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:36,299
- She's certainly, again,

2834
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:39,809
she's someone that her image is incredibly important.

2835
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:40,979
- Yes.

2836
01:45:40,979 --> 01:45:42,216
- And I mean, one of the interesting things,

2837
01:45:42,216 --> 01:45:44,452
you know, the whole question of gender in the Roman world.

2838
01:45:44,453 --> 01:45:46,650
I mean, this gets into Roman sources,

2839
01:45:46,649 --> 01:45:49,919
but of course it's a heavily male dominated history.

2840
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,170
And, I mean, men and women

2841
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:53,643
did not have equality in Ancient Rome.

2842
01:45:53,643 --> 01:45:55,620
It's a male dominated society.

2843
01:45:55,619 --> 01:45:57,748
It's misogynist in many ways.

2844
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:59,460
But what I'm constantly struck by

2845
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:02,475
is when you start, again, delving into the sources,

2846
01:46:02,475 --> 01:46:04,709
you know, you always hear, okay, you know,

2847
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:06,030
well, there was this one woman

2848
01:46:06,029 --> 01:46:07,349
who was a philosopher

2849
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:09,600
and she's an exception to the rule.

2850
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,340
And yeah, okay, she's fine.

2851
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,180
And then you start looking into,

2852
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:15,479
oh, and there's also 60 other female philosophers.

2853
01:46:15,479 --> 01:46:17,548
Well, is that so much an exception anymore?

2854
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,889
Or, you know, Cleopatra is the one queen,

2855
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:21,029
she's this strong queen.

2856
01:46:21,029 --> 01:46:21,862
And then you look and, well,

2857
01:46:21,863 --> 01:46:22,800
there was this other queen here,

2858
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:23,670
there was this queen here,

2859
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:25,200
there was this queen here who led armies,

2860
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:26,729
and here's another one who led armies.

2861
01:46:26,729 --> 01:46:28,559
And again, it's like, well,

2862
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,060
are they exceptions to the rule

2863
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:31,920
or is just the history that was written,

2864
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,480
which is written by men,

2865
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:35,938
a little bit selective in how it portrays them

2866
01:46:35,939 --> 01:46:38,608
because the sources are all these male elites

2867
01:46:38,609 --> 01:46:40,948
who have very definite ideas about women?

2868
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:43,742
You know, the conventional notion has always been that,

2869
01:46:44,729 --> 01:46:46,349
you know, business in the Roman Empire

2870
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,029
was a male field.

2871
01:46:48,029 --> 01:46:50,609
Well, but then there's this woman, Eumachia, in Pompeii,

2872
01:46:50,609 --> 01:46:53,519
who actually had the largest building in Pompeii

2873
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,350
right on the forum named after her

2874
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:56,940
with a giant statue of her,

2875
01:46:56,939 --> 01:46:58,078
and she was a patron

2876
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:00,599
to a bunch of the most important guilds in Pompeii.

2877
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,249
Okay, she's the exception to the rule.

2878
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:04,050
Oh, but then there's these other four women

2879
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,489
we have from Pompeii

2880
01:47:05,489 --> 01:47:07,498
who also were patrons of guilds.

2881
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,300
And then there's this woman, Plancia Magna,

2882
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,290
in this other place,

2883
01:47:10,289 --> 01:47:12,809
and she was the most important patron in the town

2884
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:14,520
and put up all these statues.

2885
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,409
So at some point, when do you start to say,

2886
01:47:16,409 --> 01:47:19,438
well, maybe women did play more of a role,

2887
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:22,379
but they just haven't been recorded in the sources

2888
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:24,360
in the way that maybe they deserve to be?

2889
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:25,619
- Yeah, that's a fascinating question.

2890
01:47:25,619 --> 01:47:28,018
Is it the bias of society

2891
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:30,698
or is it the bias of the historian?

2892
01:47:30,698 --> 01:47:33,178
The bias of the society that the historian is writing about

2893
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:34,167
or the bias of the actual historian?

2894
01:47:34,167 --> 01:47:35,699
- And the bias of the historians

2895
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:37,828
who have written history up to this point.

2896
01:47:37,829 --> 01:47:38,669
- Yeah.

2897
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:40,109
- I was just writing a lecture,

2898
01:47:40,109 --> 01:47:42,508
which was about this woman, Musa,

2899
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:44,250
who is a crazy story.

2900
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,980
And she ties into Augustus, actually.

2901
01:47:46,979 --> 01:47:50,608
Augustus, his biggest diplomatic triumph

2902
01:47:50,609 --> 01:47:52,798
that he boasted about constantly

2903
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,860
was that about 50 years before him,

2904
01:47:55,859 --> 01:47:58,439
the Romans had sent an expedition into Parthia,

2905
01:47:58,439 --> 01:48:01,709
this neighboring kingdom led by Crassus,

2906
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:03,420
and they'd gotten wiped out.

2907
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,740
So it was this big disaster,

2908
01:48:04,739 --> 01:48:06,089
military disaster.

2909
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:08,880
And the standards of the Roman legions,

2910
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,429
the eagles that each Roman legion carried,

2911
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:13,499
had been captured by the Parthians.

2912
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,179
And this is the most humiliating thing

2913
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:16,589
that can happen to a Roman legion,

2914
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:18,989
to have its eagles captured.

2915
01:48:18,989 --> 01:48:20,729
And Augustus desperately wanted

2916
01:48:20,729 --> 01:48:22,138
to negotiate with the Parthians

2917
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:23,1000
to get these eagles returned.

2918
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,069
Okay, this was his big diplomatic thing.

2919
01:48:26,069 --> 01:48:29,218
So he was constantly sending these embassies to Parthia.

2920
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:30,449
On one of these embassies,

2921
01:48:30,449 --> 01:48:33,118
he sent along as a gift to the Parthian king

2922
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:35,191
a slave woman named Musa.

2923
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:39,208
Musa seems to have pleased the king of Parthia

2924
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:41,790
because she becomes one of his concubines.

2925
01:48:41,789 --> 01:48:44,309
And then she gives birth to a son by the king,

2926
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:46,080
and eventually, she becomes,

2927
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:48,182
upgraded to the level of wife.

2928
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:54,590
And Musa eventually murders the Parthian King,

2929
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:01,100
arranges it so that her son becomes the king of Parthia,

2930
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:04,620
and she's really ruling the whole empire

2931
01:49:04,619 --> 01:49:06,688
behind the scenes as his mother.

2932
01:49:06,689 --> 01:49:10,979
So this is a literal rags to riches story of a slave,

2933
01:49:10,979 --> 01:49:12,449
someone who starts out a slave

2934
01:49:12,449 --> 01:49:15,689
and becomes the queen of an empire

2935
01:49:15,689 --> 01:49:18,419
almost as large and powerful as Rome.

2936
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:21,573
Okay? But yet, how often do we hear about Musa?

2937
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,080
And when you look in traditional histories

2938
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:26,909
of Roman-Parthian relations,

2939
01:49:26,909 --> 01:49:27,779
and I went and looked at this

2940
01:49:27,779 --> 01:49:29,848
because I was just writing this lecture,

2941
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:32,519
most of those histories didn't even mention her.

2942
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:33,810
They just talked about her son.

2943
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:35,189
Like he had just come out of nowhere

2944
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:38,039
and become the new heir to the Parthian throne

2945
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:40,139
when it was all her doing clearly.

2946
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:44,699
Now, that's selective editing of history by historians

2947
01:49:44,699 --> 01:49:47,401
to downplay the role that this woman played.

2948
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:51,270
And there's a lot of examples like that.

2949
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:52,409
- That's fascinating.

2950
01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:53,999
- She got overthrown after a few years.

2951
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,260
There was a revolution against her,

2952
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,1000
and we don't know what happened to her then.

2953
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,520
But she's a really interesting figure.

2954
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,010
Oh, and by the way, Augustus did negotiate

2955
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:03,570
the return of the Parthian standards

2956
01:50:03,569 --> 01:50:04,948
and got them back.

2957
01:50:04,949 --> 01:50:06,929
And he was so proud of this

2958
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:08,910
that this is what he constantly boasted about.

2959
01:50:08,909 --> 01:50:11,009
And the most famous statue of Augustus,

2960
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:12,330
the Augustus from Primaporta,

2961
01:50:12,329 --> 01:50:14,489
which is in the Vatican today,

2962
01:50:14,489 --> 01:50:16,408
he's wearing a breastplate,

2963
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:17,369
and on the breastplate,

2964
01:50:17,369 --> 01:50:18,839
right in the middle of the stomach,

2965
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,509
is a Parthian handing over a golden eagle,

2966
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:23,399
legionnaire's standard to a Roman.

2967
01:50:23,399 --> 01:50:24,739
So this is what Augustus thought of

2968
01:50:24,739 --> 01:50:26,699
as his greatest achievement.

2969
01:50:26,699 --> 01:50:29,399
And that embassy that arranged that

2970
01:50:29,399 --> 01:50:31,772
was the one that sent Musa to Parthia.

2971
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:37,439
- So Augustus marks the start of the Roman Empire.

2972
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:38,272
- Yep.

2973
01:50:38,273 --> 01:50:39,870
- You've written that Octavian Augustus

2974
01:50:39,869 --> 01:50:41,459
would become Rome's first emperor,

2975
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:44,370
and the political system that he created

2976
01:50:44,369 --> 01:50:48,569
would endure for the next half a millennium.

2977
01:50:48,569 --> 01:50:50,519
This system would become the template

2978
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,620
for countless later empires

2979
01:50:52,619 --> 01:50:54,209
up through the present day,

2980
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:56,370
and he would become the model emperor

2981
01:50:56,369 --> 01:50:58,169
against whom all subsequent ones

2982
01:50:58,170 --> 01:50:59,399
would be measured.

2983
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:02,008
The culture and history of the Mediterranean basin,

2984
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:02,940
the western world,

2985
01:51:02,939 --> 01:51:04,948
and even global history itself

2986
01:51:04,949 --> 01:51:07,228
were all profoundly shaped and influenced

2987
01:51:07,229 --> 01:51:09,838
by the actions and legacy of Octavian.

2988
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,150
He was the founder of the Roman Empire,

2989
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:16,048
and we still live today in the world that he created.

2990
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:19,770
So what, on the political side of things,

2991
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:21,240
and maybe beyond,

2992
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:24,089
what is the political system that he created?

2993
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:27,033
- Well, I mean, I think Octavian/Augustus,

2994
01:51:27,033 --> 01:51:28,440
it's the same guy,

2995
01:51:28,439 --> 01:51:30,628
is one of the most influential people in the history

2996
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:32,730
because he did found the Roman Empire.

2997
01:51:32,729 --> 01:51:34,709
So he's the one who oversaw this transition

2998
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:35,939
from republic to empire.

2999
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,229
And he sets the template,

3000
01:51:37,229 --> 01:51:39,959
which every future emperor follows.

3001
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,520
So just in the most obvious way,

3002
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:44,279
for the next either 500 or 1500 years,

3003
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:47,669
depending on how long you think the Roman Empire lasted for,

3004
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,230
everyone is trying to be Augustus.

3005
01:51:49,229 --> 01:51:51,329
They all take on the same titles.

3006
01:51:51,329 --> 01:51:54,974
Every Roman emperor after him is Caesar Augustus,

3007
01:51:54,975 --> 01:51:57,359
you know, imperator or pater patriae.

3008
01:51:57,359 --> 01:51:59,908
All these titles he has, they take too.

3009
01:51:59,909 --> 01:52:02,699
And so he's hugely influential

3010
01:52:02,699 --> 01:52:05,158
for Western civilization, all this.

3011
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:07,649
But beyond just that literal thing,

3012
01:52:07,649 --> 01:52:10,198
which is already 500 years, 1500 years,

3013
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:13,649
he becomes the paradigm of the good ruler.

3014
01:52:13,649 --> 01:52:17,249
So an absolute ruler who is nevertheless

3015
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:20,040
sort of just does good things,

3016
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:22,648
builds public works as popular.

3017
01:52:22,649 --> 01:52:25,919
So if we jump ahead, let's say, to the Middle Ages,

3018
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,560
the most significant ruler of the early Middle Ages

3019
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:29,670
is Charlemagne, right?

3020
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:31,859
He's the guy who unites most of Europe.

3021
01:52:31,859 --> 01:52:35,309
He becomes the paradigm for all medieval kings after him.

3022
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:39,209
Well, what is the title that the Pope gives to Charlemagne?

3023
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:40,409
'Cause there's this famous moment

3024
01:52:40,409 --> 01:52:42,328
when the Pope acknowledges Charlemagne

3025
01:52:42,329 --> 01:52:44,338
as the preeminent European king

3026
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:47,369
and crowns him on Christmas day of the year 800.

3027
01:52:47,369 --> 01:52:50,518
And the title that the Pope gives to Charlemagne

3028
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:54,960
is Charles, that's Charlemagne, Augustus,

3029
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,093
emperor of the Romans.

3030
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:00,388
He's giving him the title of Augustus,

3031
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:03,390
because that's the nicest thing he can think of

3032
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:04,950
to say to Charlemagne

3033
01:53:04,949 --> 01:53:06,689
is to say, "You're the new Augustus,

3034
01:53:06,689 --> 01:53:08,098
you're emperor of the Romans."

3035
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:08,1000
- Yeah.

3036
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,669
- So that image is hugely powerful,

3037
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:13,620
and that persists on and on.

3038
01:53:13,619 --> 01:53:17,849
I mean, even the literal names of most rulers afterwards

3039
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:18,840
come from this.

3040
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,560
In Russia, the Czars are Caesars.

3041
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,153
That's where Czar comes from.

3042
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,1000
Prince comes from princeps,

3043
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,069
first citizen, one of the titles.

3044
01:53:29,069 --> 01:53:31,109
Emperor comes from Imperator,

3045
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:33,298
one of the titles of Augustus.

3046
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:35,670
When Napoleon becomes emperor,

3047
01:53:35,670 --> 01:53:36,720
what does he call himself?

3048
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:39,240
First Consul, which is kind of like princeps.

3049
01:53:39,239 --> 01:53:41,102
And then he calls himself emperor.

3050
01:53:42,362 --> 01:53:45,629
I mean, everybody wants to be this kind of ruler.

3051
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:48,506
So he's the paradigm of this for the rest of history.

3052
01:53:48,506 --> 01:53:51,119
And you can see that as both a positive

3053
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:52,498
and a negative legacy.

3054
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:53,909
It's kinda like Alexander.

3055
01:53:53,909 --> 01:53:56,458
I mean, everybody wants to be the next Alexander.

3056
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:59,100
Now, nobody does become the next Alexander.

3057
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,390
Nobody's as successful as him,

3058
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:02,250
but a lot of people try.

3059
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:03,570
And you can see that either as,

3060
01:54:03,569 --> 01:54:06,209
oh, inspirational or awful,

3061
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:09,600
because lots of people killed lots of other people

3062
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,400
and started lots of wars

3063
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:13,262
trying to be the next Alexander.

3064
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:17,879
At least Augustus has this notion of good rulership.

3065
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,279
That you're not just a great powerful person,

3066
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:23,279
but you're a good ruler somehow.

3067
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:25,649
- Can you speak to the kind of political system he created?

3068
01:54:25,649 --> 01:54:30,649
So how did he consolidate power

3069
01:54:30,659 --> 01:54:32,728
as you spoke to a bit already,

3070
01:54:32,729 --> 01:54:35,849
and what role did the Senate now play?

3071
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:38,609
How were the laws,

3072
01:54:38,609 --> 01:54:39,689
who was the executive,

3073
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:41,968
how was power allocated, and so on?

3074
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:44,729
- Yeah, so once the empire begins,

3075
01:54:44,729 --> 01:54:46,108
let's say, 27 BC,

3076
01:54:46,109 --> 01:54:48,988
so in 31 BC,

3077
01:54:48,989 --> 01:54:52,198
Octavian defeats Antony at the Battle of Actium.

3078
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:54,493
So that's kind of the moment he becomes the sole ruler.

3079
01:54:54,494 --> 01:54:57,059
And then in 27 BC, a couple years later,

3080
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:58,877
he settles the Roman Republic,

3081
01:54:58,877 --> 01:55:00,060
is how it's referred to,

3082
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:02,280
which basically sets up his system.

3083
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:03,749
And in this system,

3084
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:07,049
on the surface, it all looks the same.

3085
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:08,640
You still have a Senate,

3086
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,500
each year, there's elections,

3087
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:11,970
all the Roman systems vote,

3088
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:13,230
they elect magistrates

3089
01:55:13,229 --> 01:55:15,988
who, notionally, are in charge of Rome.

3090
01:55:15,989 --> 01:55:18,509
But as I mentioned, off to the side,

3091
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:20,519
you now have this figure of Augustus

3092
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:23,640
who sort of controls everything behind the scenes.

3093
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:25,500
And that continues.

3094
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,560
So this political system he establishes continues.

3095
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,919
And in reality, I would say Augustus,

3096
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,839
at that point, is, again, a king.

3097
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,199
It really is one man controlling the state

3098
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:41,279
even if, notionally, it's still continuing as a republic.

3099
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:42,928
They are electing magistrates,

3100
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,280
but the magistrates only do

3101
01:55:44,279 --> 01:55:47,009
what the emperor tells them, right?

3102
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:49,829
But it's this sort of formal versus informal power.

3103
01:55:49,829 --> 01:55:51,958
The formal structure is a republic,

3104
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:54,660
the way things really work informally

3105
01:55:54,659 --> 01:55:56,489
is it's a monarchy.

3106
01:55:56,489 --> 01:55:59,189
Now, if you asked Augustus, what did he do?

3107
01:55:59,189 --> 01:56:00,719
Did you become a king?

3108
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,437
He said, and he says this explicitly,

3109
01:56:02,436 --> 01:56:03,508
"No, no, no.

3110
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:08,279
What I did is I refounded the Roman Republic."

3111
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:09,369
That's how he phrases it.

3112
01:56:09,369 --> 01:56:11,788
- Yeah, this guy is good at framing.

3113
01:56:11,789 --> 01:56:13,319
- He's so good at propaganda.

3114
01:56:13,319 --> 01:56:15,149
I'll give you one more example that I love.

3115
01:56:15,149 --> 01:56:17,729
Augustus actually writes his own autobiography,

3116
01:56:17,729 --> 01:56:19,289
which is very rare, and survives.

3117
01:56:19,289 --> 01:56:21,119
So here we have the autobiography

3118
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:22,979
of one of the pivotal figures in history.

3119
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:25,349
And if you had conquered the world, let's say,

3120
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:27,990
starting at the age of 18,

3121
01:56:27,989 --> 01:56:29,729
what would you call your autobiography?

3122
01:56:29,729 --> 01:56:30,562
It'd be something like, you know,

3123
01:56:30,563 --> 01:56:32,520
"How I Conquered The World," right?

3124
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,910
Augustus calls his the "Res Gestae,"

3125
01:56:35,909 --> 01:56:40,319
which the best sort of literal translation is "stuff I did."

3126
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:42,119
I mean, it's the most modest title

3127
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:45,389
for someone who could have given the most grandiose title.

3128
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,397
And the first line of it is, you know,

3129
01:56:47,396 --> 01:56:48,779
"At the age of 18,

3130
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:50,939
when the liberty of the Republic

3131
01:56:50,939 --> 01:56:53,159
was oppressed by a faction,

3132
01:56:53,159 --> 01:56:55,078
I defended it."

3133
01:56:55,079 --> 01:56:57,296
Now, the way I might phrase that sense is,

3134
01:56:57,296 --> 01:56:58,439
"At the age of 18,

3135
01:56:58,439 --> 01:57:00,689
I fought a civil war against another Roman

3136
01:57:00,689 --> 01:57:02,489
and conquered the Roman state."

3137
01:57:02,489 --> 01:57:05,009
But no, he defended the liberty of the Republic

3138
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:08,010
when it was oppressed by the tyranny of a faction.

3139
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:11,099
That's propaganda. And it works.

3140
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,420
- It is propaganda,

3141
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:15,870
but is there a degree to which he also lived it,

3142
01:57:15,869 --> 01:57:18,179
that kind of humility?

3143
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:19,500
Establishing that humility

3144
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,080
is a standard of the way government operates.

3145
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:23,099
So it's not an,

3146
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:25,709
like a literal direct balance of power,

3147
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:28,049
but it's sort of a cultural balance of power,

3148
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:29,699
where the emperor is not supposed to be

3149
01:57:29,699 --> 01:57:31,319
a bully and a dictator.

3150
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:33,598
- I would really like to know

3151
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:36,180
what Romans of his time thought.

3152
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:38,670
Like if you were alive at that moment,

3153
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:41,137
would you honestly believe,

3154
01:57:41,136 --> 01:57:43,469
"Oh, okay, we've got this guy Augustus,

3155
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:44,430
but he's brought peace,

3156
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:46,232
he's just kind of keeping in charge for a while

3157
01:57:46,233 --> 01:57:47,489
'til things settle down.

3158
01:57:47,489 --> 01:57:49,589
We've just had a hundred years of civil war.

3159
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:51,390
I think we still have a republic.

3160
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:54,300
Or would you say, "Nah, we have a king now."

3161
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,460
And I don't know what the answer to that is.

3162
01:57:56,460 --> 01:58:00,780
I will tell you that it takes 200 years

3163
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:03,868
before we have the first Roman source

3164
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:07,460
that bluntly calls Augustus a king.

3165
01:58:07,461 --> 01:58:08,670
So 200 years,

3166
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:11,1000
it takes the Romans 200 years to admit to themselves.

3167
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,757
And that's a guy who comes along 200 years later and says,

3168
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:18,719
"Hey, Augustus, he looks like a king,

3169
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,859
he acts like a king,

3170
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:21,209
let's just call him a king,

3171
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:23,489
because he had every aspect of a king

3172
01:58:23,489 --> 01:58:25,349
except the poultry title."

3173
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:26,850
- Maybe I'm buying his propaganda,

3174
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,440
and maybe I'm a sucker for humility,

3175
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:31,619
but I suspect that the Romans bought it.

3176
01:58:31,619 --> 01:58:35,128
And I also suspect he himself believed it.

3177
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:38,820
I mean, there is such thing as good kings, right?

3178
01:58:38,819 --> 01:58:42,868
There's kings that understand the downside,

3179
01:58:42,869 --> 01:58:45,151
the dark side of absolute power,

3180
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:48,089
and can wield that power properly.

3181
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:50,099
- And, you know, to give sort of both sides here,

3182
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,420
Augustus wasn't all nice.

3183
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:54,089
I mean, there were moments where he was extremely cruel.

3184
01:58:54,090 --> 01:58:55,350
So early in his career,

3185
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:57,629
when he's still fighting for power,

3186
01:58:57,630 --> 01:59:00,120
he goes all in on proscriptions,

3187
01:59:00,119 --> 01:59:02,998
which is where he and Antony and other people

3188
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,396
basically post lists of their enemies and say,

3189
01:59:06,396 --> 01:59:09,448
"It's legal for anyone to kill these people."

3190
01:59:09,449 --> 01:59:11,249
And so hundreds are massacred there,

3191
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:13,740
including Cicero, the great orator,

3192
01:59:13,739 --> 01:59:15,569
is proscribed and killed.

3193
01:59:15,569 --> 01:59:16,889
There's moments when he is really cruel.

3194
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:18,480
One slave once gets him angry

3195
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:19,829
and he has him tortured

3196
01:59:19,829 --> 01:59:21,599
in particularly sort of cruel manner.

3197
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,190
So, I mean, on the one hand,

3198
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:24,209
he had this clemency,

3199
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:25,043
on the other hand,

3200
01:59:25,042 --> 01:59:26,879
he could be really hard-nosed

3201
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,713
and hard-edged.

3202
01:59:27,712 --> 01:59:29,759
And I think he was a very calculating person.

3203
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,309
- Yeah. So the thing I would love to know

3204
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:36,060
is what he was actually like behind the mask.

3205
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:36,893
- Yes. Yes, I mean,

3206
01:59:36,893 --> 01:59:37,949
that to me is one of those, you know,

3207
01:59:37,949 --> 01:59:39,749
like if you could invite a historical person

3208
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:40,919
to dinner or whatever,

3209
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,750
I wanna know what the real Augustus was,

3210
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:44,129
what he really thought he was doing,

3211
01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:45,543
'cause he's an enigma.

3212
01:59:46,409 --> 01:59:48,779
And he has this great moment when he dies, right?

3213
01:59:48,779 --> 01:59:51,448
What's his dying lines on his deathbed?

3214
01:59:51,449 --> 01:59:54,598
He says, "If I've played my part well,

3215
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:57,180
dismiss me from the stage with applause."

3216
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:59,789
So he's seeing himself as an actor.

3217
01:59:59,789 --> 02:00:02,699
That his whole life was acting this role.

3218
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:05,609
Which is, again, all that manipulation and public image,

3219
02:00:05,609 --> 02:00:06,778
he was brilliant at that,

3220
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:08,309
but who's the real guy?

3221
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:09,780
What was behind that image?

3222
02:00:09,779 --> 02:00:10,712
- And by the way,

3223
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:13,769
as long as we're talking about brutality,

3224
02:00:13,770 --> 02:00:17,549
I think you've mentioned in a few places that

3225
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:20,429
there's a lot of brutality going on at the time,

3226
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:23,309
with Caesar just killing

3227
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:28,310
very large numbers of people brutally.

3228
02:00:28,649 --> 02:00:30,028
- I mean, Caesar,

3229
02:00:30,029 --> 02:00:32,308
his campaigns in Gaul are interesting

3230
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:34,319
because, for a long time,

3231
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:37,049
they were held up as, oh, genius general,

3232
02:00:37,050 --> 02:00:38,429
look at the amazing things he did.

3233
02:00:38,430 --> 02:00:41,099
But another way to view it is he provoked,

3234
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:43,140
and he truly provoked a war with people

3235
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:45,329
who were not that interested in fighting Rome

3236
02:00:45,329 --> 02:00:48,059
and just repeatedly attacked different tribes

3237
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:52,649
for the sole purpose of building up his career,

3238
02:00:52,649 --> 02:00:54,928
his prestige, his status,

3239
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:55,860
gaining territory,

3240
02:00:55,859 --> 02:00:57,629
making himself wealthier.

3241
02:00:57,630 --> 02:01:00,960
And he basically conquers all of modern France

3242
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,670
and Belgium and some of Switzerland.

3243
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:06,870
So this is, you know, a big chunk of Europe gets conquered.

3244
02:01:06,869 --> 02:01:08,518
Hundreds of thousands of people killed,

3245
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,409
hundreds of thousands of people enslaved

3246
02:01:10,409 --> 02:01:12,449
to further one guy's career.

3247
02:01:12,449 --> 02:01:14,098
I mean, you, if you wanted,

3248
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,200
could call Caesar a war criminal,

3249
02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:18,602
and I think that wouldn't be unfair.

3250
02:01:19,649 --> 02:01:20,549
But on the other hand,

3251
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:22,980
some people see him as a great hero.

3252
02:01:22,979 --> 02:01:25,438
I mean, to talk about history and its reception,

3253
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:29,129
it's quite interesting to see how Caesar has been viewed

3254
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:31,199
by different generations.

3255
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:33,029
So at different points in time,

3256
02:01:33,029 --> 02:01:34,079
the sort of, you know,

3257
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:37,108
received wisdom on Caesar is very different.

3258
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:40,559
So back in the, you know, let's say the 1920s or '30s,

3259
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,540
there were a number of scholarly things written,

3260
02:01:42,539 --> 02:01:47,069
which kind of looked at Caesar as an admirable figure.

3261
02:01:47,069 --> 02:01:49,678
He's a strong man who knows what Rome needed

3262
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,747
and, you know, was going to give it to them.

3263
02:01:51,747 --> 02:01:53,400
And of course, that's the era

3264
02:01:53,399 --> 02:01:55,379
when Fascism was kind of trendy

3265
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:57,120
and was seen as a positive thing.

3266
02:01:57,119 --> 02:01:58,451
And then you get, you know, Hitler and World War II

3267
02:01:58,453 --> 02:02:02,310
and all of a sudden, Fascism is not so favored anymore.

3268
02:02:02,310 --> 02:02:03,870
And then in that post-war generation,

3269
02:02:03,869 --> 02:02:05,159
all of a sudden, Caesar is terrible.

3270
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:06,409
You know, he's a dictator.

3271
02:02:06,409 --> 02:02:08,338
He is destroying the republic.

3272
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,619
So it, you know, often,

3273
02:02:10,619 --> 02:02:11,818
histories that are written

3274
02:02:11,819 --> 02:02:14,158
tell you a lot more about the time they're written

3275
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:17,069
than they do about the subject they're written about.

3276
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:19,979
- Do we know, what did Hitler

3277
02:02:19,979 --> 02:02:22,318
or Stalin think about the Roman Empire?

3278
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:25,109
- I mean, certainly, they borrow a lot of the trappings.

3279
02:02:25,109 --> 02:02:26,998
I mean, you know, Nazi Germany

3280
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,819
borrows a lot of iconography from Ancient Rome.

3281
02:02:29,819 --> 02:02:31,319
You know, I mean, they carried around

3282
02:02:31,319 --> 02:02:33,658
little military standards with eagles on them

3283
02:02:33,659 --> 02:02:35,548
just like the Romans.

3284
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:36,383
But then everybody does that.

3285
02:02:36,382 --> 02:02:38,849
I mean, the US has eagles as their standards.

3286
02:02:38,850 --> 02:02:39,989
Mussolini had them.

3287
02:02:39,989 --> 02:02:44,969
Napoleon had eagle standards for his, you know, military.

3288
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:47,913
So a lot of people like that imagery.

3289
02:02:48,989 --> 02:02:50,128
- You mentioned Cicero.

3290
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:51,509
He's a fascinating figure.

3291
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:54,059
On the topic of Roman oratory,

3292
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,053
who is Cicero?

3293
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:58,319
- Cicero was a new man.

3294
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:01,468
So he's someone who didn't have famous ancestors.

3295
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:03,389
So he was at a disadvantage.

3296
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:06,240
And I think Cicero is really interesting

3297
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:07,079
for a couple reasons.

3298
02:03:07,079 --> 02:03:09,869
One is he wrote an incredible amount.

3299
02:03:09,869 --> 02:03:12,029
I think we have almost more words from Cicero

3300
02:03:12,029 --> 02:03:13,829
than any other author that survive.

3301
02:03:13,829 --> 02:03:14,998
And it's all kinds of stuff.

3302
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,620
It's philosophical treatises,

3303
02:03:16,619 --> 02:03:18,958
it's books about how to be a good public speaker.

3304
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:21,960
He published, you know, volume after volume

3305
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,060
of his personal letters to his friends.

3306
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:26,140
He published these things.

3307
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:28,229
So there's tons of stuff from him.

3308
02:03:28,229 --> 02:03:31,528
And secondly, he's interesting because he lived at this

3309
02:03:31,529 --> 02:03:33,868
incredibly important time in the late Republic

3310
02:03:33,869 --> 02:03:35,938
when things were falling apart.

3311
02:03:35,939 --> 02:03:37,378
But he seems to have been born

3312
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:39,389
with none of the natural advantages

3313
02:03:39,390 --> 02:03:41,100
that all these other people had.

3314
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:43,680
So he was a lousy general,

3315
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:45,749
he didn't come from a wealthy family,

3316
02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:48,573
he didn't come from a famous aristocratic family,

3317
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,689
you know, he didn't have a lot of these advantages,

3318
02:03:51,689 --> 02:03:54,568
but yet he ended up being right at the center of things,

3319
02:03:54,569 --> 02:03:57,539
rose to the highest elected office in the Roman state

3320
02:03:57,539 --> 02:03:59,579
on the basis of one skill,

3321
02:03:59,579 --> 02:04:01,858
and that was his ability with words.

3322
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:04,258
His ability to get up in front of a crowd

3323
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:07,889
and persuade them of what he wanted them to believe.

3324
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:09,720
And oratory, public speaking,

3325
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:13,170
was absolutely central to life at Rome.

3326
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:14,520
There were just all these events

3327
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:17,729
where people had to get up and give speeches.

3328
02:04:17,729 --> 02:04:20,159
So in courtrooms, at funerals,

3329
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:21,749
you know, in the Senate,

3330
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:24,750
to the people of Rome, at games.

3331
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:25,710
I mean, just constantly,

3332
02:04:25,710 --> 02:04:27,870
there were these opportunities for giving speeches.

3333
02:04:27,869 --> 02:04:29,548
So if you are good at this,

3334
02:04:29,550 --> 02:04:33,780
that was a huge advantage in your political career.

3335
02:04:33,779 --> 02:04:35,759
And Cicero was the best.

3336
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:40,170
He was, arguably, the best public speaker of all time,

3337
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:41,103
some people claim.

3338
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:43,890
And he lived right in this era,

3339
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:45,930
and he parlayed that skill with words

3340
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:48,059
into this very successful political career.

3341
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:49,499
He was one of the guys involved

3342
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,330
with all this stuff with Caesar and Pompey

3343
02:04:51,329 --> 02:04:52,679
and all the other things going on.

3344
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:54,359
Octavian and Mark Antony.

3345
02:04:54,359 --> 02:04:57,118
- And you've written, which is fascinating.

3346
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:59,969
It's fascinating when the echoes of people

3347
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:03,444
from a distant past are seen today.

3348
02:05:03,444 --> 02:05:04,647
The same stuff is seen today.

3349
02:05:04,646 --> 02:05:07,589
Not just like some of the beautiful legal stuff

3350
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:08,460
that we've been talking about,

3351
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:09,903
but the tricks,

3352
02:05:10,944 --> 02:05:12,718
the, you know, let's say,

3353
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,369
the shitty stuff we see in politics.

3354
02:05:14,369 --> 02:05:17,429
So many of the rhetorical tricks you wrote,

3355
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:19,559
such as mud slinging, exaggeration,

3356
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,689
guilt by association, ad hominem attacks,

3357
02:05:21,689 --> 02:05:23,159
name calling, fear mongering,

3358
02:05:23,159 --> 02:05:25,379
us versus them, rhyme, and so on and so forth.

3359
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,330
So I'm guessing it worked

3360
02:05:27,329 --> 02:05:28,738
given that we still have those today?

3361
02:05:28,739 --> 02:05:30,599
- Yeah, I mean, one of the things Cicero did

3362
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:33,899
is he wrote at least three of these sort of handbooks

3363
02:05:33,899 --> 02:05:35,489
about how to be a good public speaker.

3364
02:05:35,489 --> 02:05:37,408
So we know a lot about that,

3365
02:05:37,409 --> 02:05:39,298
we have his own speeches that survive,

3366
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:41,280
and then we have later people after Cicero

3367
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:42,599
who wrote about what Cicero did too.

3368
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:45,030
So we know a lot about what he did.

3369
02:05:45,029 --> 02:05:49,288
And the key to Cicero's whole enterprise

3370
02:05:49,289 --> 02:05:50,579
about persuading an audience,

3371
02:05:50,579 --> 02:05:52,978
let's say either in a speech to the people

3372
02:05:52,979 --> 02:05:54,599
or in the courtroom,

3373
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:56,400
is Cicero believed that people

3374
02:05:56,399 --> 02:05:58,802
are fundamentally ruled by emotion.

3375
02:05:59,789 --> 02:06:02,729
So if you can touch their emotions,

3376
02:06:02,729 --> 02:06:06,119
all sorts of other things become less important.

3377
02:06:06,119 --> 02:06:09,239
If you can get a jury emotionally worked up,

3378
02:06:09,239 --> 02:06:12,929
and fear, anger are particularly powerful there,

3379
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:15,329
then the facts might not matter,

3380
02:06:15,329 --> 02:06:17,099
the truth might not matter,

3381
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:19,620
evidence might not matter,

3382
02:06:19,619 --> 02:06:21,569
reason might not matter.

3383
02:06:21,569 --> 02:06:24,209
Emotion is the key to everything.

3384
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:29,040
So Cicero used what I would arguably call a lot of tricks

3385
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:32,309
to get his audiences emotionally riled up.

3386
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:33,870
And you can just go through these,

3387
02:06:33,869 --> 02:06:34,979
and they're all the stuff you were saying.

3388
02:06:34,979 --> 02:06:37,289
You know, name calling,

3389
02:06:37,289 --> 02:06:39,029
you know, mud slinging,

3390
02:06:39,029 --> 02:06:41,459
us versus them arguments,

3391
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:44,069
you know, ad hominem attacks.

3392
02:06:44,069 --> 02:06:45,718
I mean, incredibly sophisticated.

3393
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,220
All this stuff that we think of today as,

3394
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:50,010
oh, very sophisticated techniques for,

3395
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:51,840
you know, propaganda and persuasion,

3396
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,249
it's not new.

3397
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:56,100
People aren't coming up with that much that's new

3398
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:57,600
outside the realm of technology.

3399
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,160
Human nature is the same.

3400
02:06:59,159 --> 02:07:00,989
Cicero understood human psychology.

3401
02:07:00,989 --> 02:07:03,118
He knew how to play on people.

3402
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:05,038
He knew how to play on their emotions.

3403
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:06,430
And he would do just,

3404
02:07:06,430 --> 02:07:07,589
I mean, I wanna say hilarious,

3405
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:10,409
but they're sort of depressingly hilarious things.

3406
02:07:10,409 --> 02:07:13,589
Like he thought it's important to use props.

3407
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:16,139
So he said, you know, people are visual.

3408
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:18,419
They will respond emotionally to visual things

3409
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:20,730
in a way that just words alone won't work.

3410
02:07:20,729 --> 02:07:23,999
So he says an orator is just like an actor,

3411
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,520
and like an actor, he has to prepare his stage

3412
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:29,339
and use props and, you know,

3413
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:32,429
things as, you know, visual cues

3414
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:33,869
to stir up the audience.

3415
02:07:33,869 --> 02:07:36,239
So for example, once, he was defending a man

3416
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:37,139
in a court case

3417
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:39,749
who had just had a new baby born to him,

3418
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:41,819
and Cicero literally delivered

3419
02:07:41,819 --> 02:07:43,828
the defense oration for this guy

3420
02:07:43,829 --> 02:07:45,876
while cradling his newborn son in his arms.

3421
02:07:45,877 --> 02:07:48,840
You know, you can imagine, "Oh, cute little baby.

3422
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:50,849
Jury, how could you find him guilty

3423
02:07:50,850 --> 02:07:52,049
and leave this cute baby

3424
02:07:52,050 --> 02:07:54,840
without a father to take care of him?"

3425
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,489
Another time, he was defending a guy

3426
02:07:56,489 --> 02:07:57,515
who had a photogenic son,

3427
02:07:57,516 --> 02:07:59,278
a kind of a young boy.

3428
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:02,038
And Cicero literally propped up the kid behind him

3429
02:08:02,039 --> 02:08:03,268
while he was giving the speech

3430
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:06,629
and again, said, "Look at his eyes brimming with tears

3431
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:08,850
thinking about his father, you know, being punished.

3432
02:08:08,850 --> 02:08:10,560
How could you leave this wonderful boy

3433
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:13,560
without, you know, a father to care for him?"

3434
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:15,300
Another time, someone didn't have photogenic kids

3435
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,119
so he propped up his old parents in the courtroom

3436
02:08:18,119 --> 02:08:19,709
and said, "Look at this nice, old couple,

3437
02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:22,440
you won't wanna take their son away."

3438
02:08:22,439 --> 02:08:23,759
You know, that kind of stuff.

3439
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,980
I mean, it's manipulative.

3440
02:08:25,979 --> 02:08:27,029
Cicero, by the way, I should say,

3441
02:08:27,029 --> 02:08:29,488
also had philosophical beliefs

3442
02:08:29,489 --> 02:08:31,558
about defending the republic and such,

3443
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:33,449
but he wasn't above using these things.

3444
02:08:33,449 --> 02:08:36,359
So even though he may have had altruistic

3445
02:08:36,359 --> 02:08:39,299
or high notions of, you know,

3446
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:40,350
what he was doing,

3447
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:43,620
he also wasn't above using these kind of rhetorical tricks.

3448
02:08:43,619 --> 02:08:44,729
- And also you mentioned to me

3449
02:08:44,729 --> 02:08:48,289
that you studied the gestures they used.

3450
02:08:48,289 --> 02:08:49,769
So like, this is one of those,

3451
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:51,030
oh, like on the theme of

3452
02:08:51,029 --> 02:08:55,378
extremely interesting details of life.

3453
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:58,080
- This was actually my dissertation.

3454
02:08:58,079 --> 02:08:58,945
And it was my first book as well.

3455
02:08:58,945 --> 02:09:00,958
- That's amazing. That's amazing.

3456
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:03,029
- Again, I tell you, I like practical stuff.

3457
02:09:03,029 --> 02:09:04,769
And this all started with,

3458
02:09:04,770 --> 02:09:08,100
I kept reading about people like Cicero giving speeches,

3459
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:09,150
okay, in ancient Rome.

3460
02:09:09,149 --> 02:09:10,588
Lots of speeches.

3461
02:09:10,590 --> 02:09:12,060
And they would give a speech in the forum

3462
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:14,220
with 10, 20,000 people.

3463
02:09:14,220 --> 02:09:15,270
And the thought occurred to me,

3464
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:17,939
well, in Ancient Rome, you don't have microphones,

3465
02:09:17,939 --> 02:09:19,979
you don't have loudspeakers.

3466
02:09:19,979 --> 02:09:24,509
So how does someone give a speech outdoors in a windy place

3467
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:27,570
not acoustically sound to 20,000 people?

3468
02:09:27,569 --> 02:09:29,369
They just can't hear you.

3469
02:09:29,369 --> 02:09:31,529
And the answer, part of the answer,

3470
02:09:31,529 --> 02:09:33,178
it turns out, well, part of oratorical training,

3471
02:09:33,180 --> 02:09:35,010
you learn how to project your voice.

3472
02:09:35,010 --> 02:09:36,209
But some of it too is that

3473
02:09:36,210 --> 02:09:39,569
the Romans actually had this system of gestures

3474
02:09:39,569 --> 02:09:41,429
that orators like Cicero would use

3475
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:43,590
to accompany their speeches.

3476
02:09:43,590 --> 02:09:45,120
And what I ended up doing

3477
02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:47,909
is combining two types of evidence again.

3478
02:09:47,909 --> 02:09:51,629
So I looked at the oratorical handbooks like Cicero's,

3479
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:53,309
and also there's this guy Quintilian,

3480
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:55,919
who lived about hundred years after Cicero,

3481
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:57,216
who wrote this long thing called

3482
02:09:57,216 --> 02:09:59,069
"The Institutio Oratoria,"

3483
02:09:59,069 --> 02:10:02,698
which has a description of all types of oratorical stuff,

3484
02:10:02,699 --> 02:10:05,308
including about 40 pages on gestures.

3485
02:10:05,310 --> 02:10:06,143
So he actually says,

3486
02:10:06,143 --> 02:10:06,976
when you put your fingers like this,

3487
02:10:06,975 --> 02:10:08,908
it means such and such. - Nice.

3488
02:10:08,909 --> 02:10:09,749
- And it turns out,

3489
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:12,123
Roman orators had a system of sign language

3490
02:10:12,122 --> 02:10:14,879
that they would use to augment their speeches.

3491
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,079
But here's the fun part.

3492
02:10:16,949 --> 02:10:19,978
It wasn't like modern American sign language

3493
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:23,369
where a gesture means the same thing as a word.

3494
02:10:23,369 --> 02:10:25,679
Instead, and this goes back to Cicero,

3495
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:29,1000
a certain gesture would indicate a certain emotion

3496
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,629
that you were meant to feel when you heard the words.

3497
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:35,460
So it's like your body

3498
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:39,210
is adding an emotional gloss to your speech.

3499
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:40,500
You're saying words,

3500
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:41,610
and then you're indicating

3501
02:10:41,609 --> 02:10:43,948
how you think those words should make you feel.

3502
02:10:43,949 --> 02:10:46,558
And even more fun, the Romans believed

3503
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:49,140
that if I make certain hand gestures,

3504
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:53,580
you will almost involuntarily feel certain emotions.

3505
02:10:53,579 --> 02:10:54,659
So if you're skilled,

3506
02:10:54,659 --> 02:10:56,429
you can manipulate your audience

3507
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:58,050
by playing on their emotions.

3508
02:10:58,050 --> 02:11:00,960
And this might sound, you know, kind of weird or improbable,

3509
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,390
but the metaphor that Cicero himself uses

3510
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:05,220
is he says think about music.

3511
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:07,619
Everybody knows that certain musical tones

3512
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:09,719
will make you feel a certain way.

3513
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:11,430
So, you know, think of movies today.

3514
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:12,809
In a horror movie, you know,

3515
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:15,089
they're gonna play strident tense music.

3516
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:16,229
In a romantic scene,

3517
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:17,428
you're gonna have strings.

3518
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:18,960
And it'll make you feel a certain way.

3519
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:20,580
When you hear the "Jaws" theme,

3520
02:11:20,579 --> 02:11:22,529
you feel tense, right?

3521
02:11:22,529 --> 02:11:26,069
Cicero said the orator's body is like a lyre,

3522
02:11:26,069 --> 02:11:26,902
a lyre is a musical instrument,

3523
02:11:26,903 --> 02:11:30,390
and you have to learn to play on your own body

3524
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:31,710
as a musical instrument

3525
02:11:31,710 --> 02:11:33,480
to affect the emotions of your audience.

3526
02:11:33,479 --> 02:11:34,949
- I think he might be onto something,

3527
02:11:34,949 --> 02:11:37,589
especially given how central public speaking was-

3528
02:11:37,590 --> 02:11:38,423
- Yeah. - to Roman culture.

3529
02:11:38,422 --> 02:11:41,039
- And a lot of the Roman oratorical gestures,

3530
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:42,509
like I could probably do some,

3531
02:11:42,510 --> 02:11:43,739
and you could probably guess

3532
02:11:43,739 --> 02:11:45,719
what emotion they're meant to be.

3533
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:47,399
So for example, there's one where like

3534
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:49,169
you hold up your hands to the side

3535
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:51,150
and kind of push like this.

3536
02:11:51,149 --> 02:11:53,009
So this is the gesture,

3537
02:11:53,010 --> 02:11:55,230
and what that means is kind of mild diversion.

3538
02:11:55,229 --> 02:11:56,549
I don't like something.

3539
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:59,309
Now, if I couple this with turning my face

3540
02:11:59,310 --> 02:12:01,020
to the side, like that...

3541
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:02,520
So pushing off to one side,

3542
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:03,420
turning my face away,

3543
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:04,410
it's a strong aversion.

3544
02:12:04,409 --> 02:12:06,149
That's like fear or something.

3545
02:12:06,149 --> 02:12:08,729
If I clench my fist and press it to my chest,

3546
02:12:08,729 --> 02:12:10,679
that's anger or grief.

3547
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:14,189
If I slap my thigh, again, that's indication of anger.

3548
02:12:14,189 --> 02:12:16,289
So a lot of these make sense.

3549
02:12:16,289 --> 02:12:17,999
I mean, they're kind of natural gestures.

3550
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,145
Now, some are really weird and artificial.

3551
02:12:21,145 --> 02:12:22,350
I mean, one of my favorite of these

3552
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:24,959
is if you like hold your hand up open,

3553
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,120
and then curl the fingers in one by one,

3554
02:12:27,119 --> 02:12:28,379
and then flip it out,

3555
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:30,719
so this sort of thing,

3556
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:33,479
that to the Romans meant wonder,

3557
02:12:33,479 --> 02:12:35,548
which you sort of see.

3558
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:39,030
But, again, if you've been raised in a societal context

3559
02:12:39,029 --> 02:12:40,769
where you're used to the notion

3560
02:12:40,770 --> 02:12:43,020
that this gesture means this emotion,-

3561
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:44,370
- Oh yeah. - when someone does it,

3562
02:12:44,369 --> 02:12:46,319
you're probably gonna feel that emotions.

3563
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:47,429
- It's like memes today.

3564
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:48,869
Is if it becomes viral-

3565
02:12:48,869 --> 02:12:50,159
- You know what it's supposed to mean-

3566
02:12:50,161 --> 02:12:52,369
- (indistinct) and has power. - and it has that effect

3567
02:12:52,368 --> 02:12:54,779
- I mean, and it's actually interesting

3568
02:12:54,779 --> 02:12:57,988
that we don't use gestures as much in modern day.

3569
02:12:57,989 --> 02:12:58,919
- Well, I mean, for me,

3570
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:01,770
I just love analyzing modern political figures

3571
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:03,240
in terms of their body language.

3572
02:13:03,239 --> 02:13:04,319
- Yes, yeah.

3573
02:13:04,319 --> 02:13:06,928
- Because how you deliver a speech

3574
02:13:06,930 --> 02:13:10,050
is often more important than what you say.

3575
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:12,300
In fact, in the ancient world,

3576
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:15,809
the most famous Greek orator was a guy named Demosthenes.

3577
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:18,030
And once, a guy came up to Demosthenes

3578
02:13:18,029 --> 02:13:18,989
and said, "Demosthenes,

3579
02:13:18,989 --> 02:13:21,178
tell me what are the three most important things

3580
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:23,040
in giving a speech?

3581
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:24,749
And Demosthenes said, "Well,

3582
02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:28,649
they are delivery, delivery, and delivery."

3583
02:13:28,649 --> 02:13:31,678
That even the most brilliant speech,

3584
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:34,349
if accompanied by a boring delivery,

3585
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:37,379
is gonna be less effective than a terrible speech

3586
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:41,219
given in an engaging and exciting or funny way.

3587
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:42,720
- Speaking of modern day and gestures,

3588
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:45,840
what do you think of Donald Trump

3589
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:48,810
who has these very unique kind of gestures?

3590
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:49,643
I think there's...

3591
02:13:49,643 --> 02:13:51,600
I don't know the degree to it's true,

3592
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:53,130
but he kind of uses these handshakes

3593
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:54,210
when he pulls people in,

3594
02:13:54,210 --> 02:13:55,470
that kind of stuff.

3595
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:56,669
What do you make of that?

3596
02:13:56,670 --> 02:13:59,759
- I mean, Trump gesticulate a lot,

3597
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:02,369
but it's a fairly narrow set of gestures.

3598
02:14:02,369 --> 02:14:03,719
I mean, if you watch him for a bit,

3599
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:07,200
he kind of has the same small set of gestures.

3600
02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:08,909
And they're not,

3601
02:14:08,909 --> 02:14:10,529
I wanna say they're not natural

3602
02:14:10,529 --> 02:14:13,169
in that they're not kind of illustrating what he's saying.

3603
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:15,509
It's more just punctuation points.

3604
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:18,269
I think of his as more kind of these punctuation points

3605
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:20,609
for just going along with what he's saying.

3606
02:14:20,609 --> 02:14:23,158
There are speakers who truly can use

3607
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:27,269
their hands and arms and faces creatively,

3608
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:28,590
and you watch them

3609
02:14:28,590 --> 02:14:31,440
and it's really enhancing the speech.

3610
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:32,759
I mean, just historically,

3611
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:34,080
you know, Martin Luther King,

3612
02:14:34,079 --> 02:14:36,088
he's famous for a lot of good speeches content.

3613
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:38,820
He was a good gesticulator too.

3614
02:14:38,819 --> 02:14:40,948
He knew how to use his body.

3615
02:14:40,949 --> 02:14:41,819
On the other hand,

3616
02:14:41,819 --> 02:14:45,209
Adolf Hitler was a phenomenal gesticulator.

3617
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:47,040
If you watch some of his speeches,

3618
02:14:47,039 --> 02:14:48,509
even just like turn off the sound

3619
02:14:48,510 --> 02:14:49,440
and watch them,

3620
02:14:49,439 --> 02:14:51,149
he's doing all kinds of stuff

3621
02:14:51,149 --> 02:14:53,399
and he's really emphasizing his points

3622
02:14:53,399 --> 02:14:55,019
in a very creative way.

3623
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,779
And this is what's fascinating

3624
02:14:57,779 --> 02:14:59,458
about oratory and public speaking

3625
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:01,469
is it's this two-edged sword.

3626
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:04,110
You can use these techniques for good

3627
02:15:04,109 --> 02:15:07,618
or you can absolutely use them for evil, you know?

3628
02:15:07,619 --> 02:15:08,452
- [Lex] Yeah.

3629
02:15:08,453 --> 02:15:10,320
- So the very same techniques

3630
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:12,569
in the hands of, you know, MLK,

3631
02:15:12,569 --> 02:15:13,768
you say, "This is wonderful,

3632
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:14,760
this is fantastic,"

3633
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:17,340
in the hands of Hitler, you say, "This is awful.

3634
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:20,639
Look, he's persuading a nation to commit atrocities."

3635
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:23,189
- I encourage people to watch the speeches of Hitler,

3636
02:15:23,189 --> 02:15:25,169
the oratory skill there. - Yeah.

3637
02:15:25,170 --> 02:15:29,820
- To be able to channel the resentment

3638
02:15:29,819 --> 02:15:32,762
and the frustration of a people,

3639
02:15:33,659 --> 02:15:36,839
and control it,

3640
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:39,119
and direct it to any direction you want-

3641
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:41,219
- Yes. - through speaking alone...

3642
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:43,769
- It's the visual embodiment of the words

3643
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:44,730
where he's talking about,

3644
02:15:44,729 --> 02:15:45,898
you know, Weimar, Germany

3645
02:15:45,899 --> 02:15:47,788
being taken advantage of, supposedly,

3646
02:15:47,789 --> 02:15:48,622
and all this stuff.

3647
02:15:48,622 --> 02:15:52,498
You're right, he's channeling the resentment of the people

3648
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:55,200
and using that to his personal advantage

3649
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:56,848
and for cynical,

3650
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:59,220
evil, really, purposes.

3651
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:00,053
But oratory is like that.

3652
02:16:00,052 --> 02:16:01,828
You know, it's...

3653
02:16:01,829 --> 02:16:04,199
The question I always end up asking my students is,

3654
02:16:04,199 --> 02:16:06,449
after studying Cicero and all these techniques,

3655
02:16:06,449 --> 02:16:08,879
I say, "Okay, this is great oratory,

3656
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:10,230
but do you like this?

3657
02:16:10,229 --> 02:16:13,469
Is this good that this works on human beings?"

3658
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:16,236
- I remember Noam Chomsky once was asked,

3659
02:16:16,237 --> 02:16:17,787
"Why do you speak in such a monotone way?"

3660
02:16:17,787 --> 02:16:22,200
And he said, "Well, I want the truth of my statement,

3661
02:16:22,199 --> 02:16:24,208
the contents of my statements to speak,

3662
02:16:24,210 --> 02:16:27,960
that I don't want you to get diluted by me

3663
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:31,319
because I'm such a charismatic and eloquent speaker.

3664
02:16:31,319 --> 02:16:32,609
The more monotone I speak,

3665
02:16:32,610 --> 02:16:34,499
the more you will listen to the content of the words."

3666
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:36,629
- Right, I want you just focusing on the content

3667
02:16:36,629 --> 02:16:38,219
and not being distracted.

3668
02:16:38,219 --> 02:16:39,779
I'll tell you also, with Cicero,

3669
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:42,720
one of the things that he and other people

3670
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:44,795
who write about Roman oratory do is to say,

3671
02:16:44,797 --> 02:16:46,860
"And you can do this stuff badly,

3672
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:49,619
in which case it backfires horribly."

3673
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:52,140
So you can have people who attempt to gesticulate,

3674
02:16:52,139 --> 02:16:54,449
and again, modern politicians, you'll see this sometime

3675
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:55,283
where they feel like

3676
02:16:55,282 --> 02:16:57,389
"I'm supposed to be making hand gestures,"

3677
02:16:57,389 --> 02:16:58,236
and they're terrible at it-

3678
02:16:58,236 --> 02:17:00,509
- Yeah. - and it undercuts it.

3679
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:01,870
And Cicero and Quintilian

3680
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:04,649
gives some very amusing examples from Ancient Rome.

3681
02:17:04,649 --> 02:17:06,629
So like he says there was this one guy,

3682
02:17:06,629 --> 02:17:07,462
who, when he spoke,

3683
02:17:07,462 --> 02:17:10,079
looked like he was trying to swat away flies, you know,

3684
02:17:10,079 --> 02:17:11,968
'cause there were just these awkward gestures,

3685
02:17:11,969 --> 02:17:12,929
or another who looked like

3686
02:17:12,930 --> 02:17:14,609
he was trying to balance in a boat,

3687
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:17,219
like in, you know, choppy seas.

3688
02:17:17,219 --> 02:17:19,288
And my favorite is there was one orator

3689
02:17:19,290 --> 02:17:21,720
who supposedly was prone to making,

3690
02:17:21,719 --> 02:17:24,989
I guess, kind of languid supple motions.

3691
02:17:24,989 --> 02:17:28,739
And so they actually named a dance after this guy.

3692
02:17:28,739 --> 02:17:30,607
And his name was Titius.

3693
02:17:30,608 --> 02:17:32,910
And so Romans could do the Titius,

3694
02:17:32,909 --> 02:17:35,969
which is this dance that was imitating this orator

3695
02:17:35,969 --> 02:17:36,869
who had these, you know,

3696
02:17:36,870 --> 02:17:40,560
kind of comically bad gesticulation.

3697
02:17:40,559 --> 02:17:43,438
So not enough gesticulation is a problem.

3698
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:45,719
Too much gesticulation is a problem.

3699
02:17:45,719 --> 02:17:47,398
You have to hit the sweet spot.

3700
02:17:47,399 --> 02:17:50,519
It has to seem natural, it has to seem varied.

3701
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:52,916
It has to conform to the meaning of the words

3702
02:17:52,916 --> 02:17:54,389
and not distract from it.

3703
02:17:54,389 --> 02:17:55,469
- Yeah, natural to your,

3704
02:17:55,469 --> 02:17:57,062
like authentic to who you are- - Yeah, authentic.

3705
02:17:57,063 --> 02:17:59,220
- which is when people try to copy

3706
02:17:59,219 --> 02:18:00,839
the gesture of another person,

3707
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:02,100
it usually doesn't go well.

3708
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:03,600
- Right. - You have to kind of,

3709
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:04,739
yeah, you have to interpret,

3710
02:18:04,739 --> 02:18:06,806
integrate into your own personality and so on.

3711
02:18:06,807 --> 02:18:08,640
- But gestures is really fun.

3712
02:18:08,639 --> 02:18:09,778
- It's fascinating.

3713
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:13,799
- I enjoyed my dissertation a lot doing that.

3714
02:18:13,799 --> 02:18:14,639
'Cause what I was trying to do there

3715
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:16,799
was to literally reconstruct them, so to say.

3716
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:18,258
What were the actual gestures?

3717
02:18:18,259 --> 02:18:20,009
And I did that by comparing

3718
02:18:20,010 --> 02:18:21,630
the literary accounts of the handbooks

3719
02:18:21,629 --> 02:18:22,828
with, again, Roman art.

3720
02:18:22,829 --> 02:18:24,838
Looking at statues of Romans and things,

3721
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,219
and just trying to say, "Okay,

3722
02:18:26,219 --> 02:18:28,558
what were some of the gestures they actually used here?"

3723
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:31,205
- And in that way,

3724
02:18:31,207 --> 02:18:32,999
the people from that time come to life

3725
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,439
in your mind, in your work,

3726
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,530
which is this fascinating.

3727
02:18:35,531 --> 02:18:36,625
- Well, again, this pragmatic thing.

3728
02:18:36,626 --> 02:18:38,453
I want to know, okay, how does this work?

3729
02:18:39,989 --> 02:18:43,239
- Could we talk about the role of religion

3730
02:18:44,250 --> 02:18:45,813
in the Roman Empire?

3731
02:18:46,889 --> 02:18:48,122
What's the story there?

3732
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:50,339
- I mean, religion is interesting

3733
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:53,219
because, in my mind,

3734
02:18:53,219 --> 02:18:58,079
the rise to dominance in a lot of the world

3735
02:18:58,079 --> 02:18:59,728
of monotheistic religions

3736
02:18:59,729 --> 02:19:02,699
is one of the huge sort of turning points,

3737
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:05,099
'cause it's just such a different mentality.

3738
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:08,257
I mean, it's very, very different where you say,

3739
02:19:08,256 --> 02:19:10,978
"There's one God, and it's my God,"

3740
02:19:10,979 --> 02:19:13,168
versus, "Okay, I believe in this God,

3741
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:16,379
but there's an infinite number of legitimate gods."

3742
02:19:16,379 --> 02:19:18,388
And nowadays, particularly in the West,

3743
02:19:18,389 --> 02:19:22,922
we tend to view the monotheistic perspective as the norm.

3744
02:19:23,819 --> 02:19:24,958
But for, you know,

3745
02:19:24,959 --> 02:19:26,429
more than half of human history,

3746
02:19:26,430 --> 02:19:28,107
it was not.

3747
02:19:28,106 --> 02:19:31,679
You know, it used to be the notion in a lot of Roman history

3748
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:34,349
up until about 300 AD.

3749
02:19:34,350 --> 02:19:35,640
The idea was, well,

3750
02:19:35,639 --> 02:19:37,918
there's just a ton of gods floating around

3751
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,750
and, you know, maybe you worship that one,

3752
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:41,333
and I worship these two that I like,

3753
02:19:41,333 --> 02:19:42,810
and the guy across the street

3754
02:19:42,809 --> 02:19:44,549
worships the oak tree in his backyard,

3755
02:19:44,549 --> 02:19:45,449
and it's all good.

3756
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:48,120
They're all legitimate things.

3757
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:49,590
Versus, "Oh, no, no, no.

3758
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:51,090
Now, there is one God

3759
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:54,270
and only one God that's the correct answer."

3760
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:55,469
And as soon as you do that,

3761
02:19:55,469 --> 02:19:57,959
religion becomes foregrounded

3762
02:19:57,959 --> 02:20:00,479
in your decision-making much more.

3763
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:02,488
I mean, the Romans had religion,

3764
02:20:02,489 --> 02:20:04,498
but it wasn't really driving anything,

3765
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,699
if you know what I mean.

3766
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:09,450
It was auxiliary to things rather than a central force.

3767
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:11,490
So for a lot of Roman history,

3768
02:20:11,489 --> 02:20:14,189
you had a standard kind of, you know,

3769
02:20:14,190 --> 02:20:15,900
I guess, pagan polytheism

3770
02:20:15,899 --> 02:20:17,699
where there's a bunch of gods,

3771
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:18,533
there's certain gods

3772
02:20:18,532 --> 02:20:20,449
who are associated with the Roman state,

3773
02:20:21,389 --> 02:20:24,268
and there would be prayers said to those gods

3774
02:20:24,270 --> 02:20:26,279
on behalf of the Roman state,

3775
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:28,260
but it wasn't really, you know,

3776
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:31,349
you weren't trying to execute the will of Zeus or something,

3777
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:34,050
or of Jupiter, or Mars, or anybody else.

3778
02:20:34,049 --> 02:20:36,089
And in your private life, it was the same thing.

3779
02:20:36,090 --> 02:20:37,950
You might ask certain gods for help,

3780
02:20:37,950 --> 02:20:40,619
but it wasn't as much of a dominant thing

3781
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:42,570
in your own existence.

3782
02:20:42,569 --> 02:20:45,059
So I think that's a real transition point

3783
02:20:45,059 --> 02:20:48,148
where religion started to become so foregrounded.

3784
02:20:48,149 --> 02:20:51,358
And as soon as you get the monotheistic religions,

3785
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:52,470
Judaism, Christianity,

3786
02:20:52,469 --> 02:20:54,118
and Islam, in particular,

3787
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:57,030
it really shifts how people start to think about themselves

3788
02:20:57,030 --> 02:20:59,610
in relationship to the world around them.

3789
02:20:59,610 --> 02:21:03,720
- So Jesus was born during the rule of Emperor Augustus.

3790
02:21:03,719 --> 02:21:06,089
- Yep. And which is kind of neat that, you know,

3791
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:09,270
really influential people in the realm of political events

3792
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:11,842
and religious events coexisted.

3793
02:21:11,842 --> 02:21:13,743
- Or... - What are the odds?

3794
02:21:14,579 --> 02:21:16,829
- I mean, yeah, there's certain moments in history

3795
02:21:16,829 --> 02:21:19,319
where just a lot of interesting, powerful people

3796
02:21:19,319 --> 02:21:21,362
come together and make history.

3797
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:25,320
So, and he was crucified under Emperor Tiberius rule.

3798
02:21:25,319 --> 02:21:26,789
- [Gregory] Yep.

3799
02:21:26,790 --> 02:21:28,859
- [Lex] Why were the ideas of Jesus

3800
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:31,263
seen as a threat by the emperor?

3801
02:21:32,129 --> 02:21:36,359
- The thing that causes conflicts

3802
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:38,790
between the Romans and Christians

3803
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:40,199
is a little bit strange.

3804
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:41,643
It's all with this,

3805
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:45,299
where the Romans had a tradition of,

3806
02:21:45,299 --> 02:21:47,009
on the emperor's birthday,

3807
02:21:47,010 --> 02:21:48,300
sort of saying a prayer,

3808
02:21:48,299 --> 02:21:50,729
basically, wishing him good luck, okay?

3809
02:21:50,729 --> 02:21:52,079
But technically, it's in the form

3810
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:55,199
of sacrificing to that part of the emperor

3811
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,659
that might become divine after his death.

3812
02:21:57,659 --> 02:21:58,709
So to the Romans,

3813
02:21:58,709 --> 02:22:02,159
this is the equivalent of a patriotism act,

3814
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:03,479
saying, you know, the pledge of allegiance

3815
02:22:03,479 --> 02:22:04,949
or something to the country.

3816
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:06,240
But of course, to Christians,

3817
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:08,489
this is worshiping another God.

3818
02:22:08,489 --> 02:22:11,279
And I think there's almost a failure of communication here.

3819
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:13,289
That the Romans just, at least initially,

3820
02:22:13,290 --> 02:22:14,459
didn't quite understand

3821
02:22:14,459 --> 02:22:16,648
this is really problematic for these people,

3822
02:22:16,649 --> 02:22:19,499
because they're coming from a polytheistic perspective

3823
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:21,839
where, yeah, everybody has different gods, so what?

3824
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:24,360
This isn't a religious problem,

3825
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,759
this is a political one

3826
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:28,800
that why won't you wish, you know,

3827
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:30,059
send good wishes to the emperor?

3828
02:22:30,059 --> 02:22:31,379
If you're a loyal Roman,

3829
02:22:31,379 --> 02:22:33,928
this is something you should want to do.

3830
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:35,520
And many of the early Christians, I think,

3831
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,959
would've been fine with that,

3832
02:22:36,959 --> 02:22:40,139
but it took the form of what they were asked to be do

3833
02:22:40,139 --> 02:22:44,249
was to basically worship another God.

3834
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:46,410
And that was the sticking point.

3835
02:22:46,409 --> 02:22:48,359
And this is where I think movies

3836
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:49,559
have kind of warped

3837
02:22:49,559 --> 02:22:51,958
some of our images of Roman history.

3838
02:22:51,959 --> 02:22:56,338
That Hollywood loves to depict very early Christians,

3839
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,200
and I'm talking like first 200 years

3840
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:00,959
hereafter the ministry of Christ,

3841
02:23:00,959 --> 02:23:03,358
as, you know, a group

3842
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:05,190
that all the Romans were obsessed with,

3843
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:07,830
that they were constantly trying to persecute, and all this.

3844
02:23:07,829 --> 02:23:09,898
And honestly, I think the Romans at that point

3845
02:23:09,899 --> 02:23:11,699
were more just sort of indifferent

3846
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:13,470
or didn't know what was going on.

3847
02:23:13,469 --> 02:23:16,199
And if you look at some of the primary sources at that time,

3848
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,060
I mean, there's this very famous letter

3849
02:23:18,059 --> 02:23:19,948
by a guy named Pliny,

3850
02:23:19,950 --> 02:23:24,030
who was a Roman governor of a province in the east.

3851
02:23:24,030 --> 02:23:25,980
And he has the habit of writing letters

3852
02:23:25,979 --> 02:23:27,329
to the Roman emperor at the time,

3853
02:23:27,329 --> 02:23:28,169
who was Trajan,

3854
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:31,500
every time he had a problem with being governor.

3855
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:32,729
And so this is great.

3856
02:23:32,729 --> 02:23:35,459
This is the two highest governmental officials

3857
02:23:35,459 --> 02:23:36,688
in the Roman world

3858
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:38,910
sort of hammering out policy between them, right?

3859
02:23:38,909 --> 02:23:40,889
The emperor and one of his governors.

3860
02:23:40,889 --> 02:23:42,359
And so this is about a hundred years,

3861
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:43,860
a hundred AD about,

3862
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:46,500
and Pliny says, "Hey, emperor,

3863
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:47,550
I had this issue,

3864
02:23:47,549 --> 02:23:50,098
I had these people come before me called Christians.

3865
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,749
I don't quite know what to do with them.

3866
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:53,730
What should my policy be?

3867
02:23:53,729 --> 02:23:55,138
And here's what I know about them."

3868
02:23:55,139 --> 02:23:56,669
And what he knows is almost nothing.

3869
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:58,230
I mean, it's this

3870
02:23:58,229 --> 02:23:59,796
almost comic, like, garbling.

3871
02:23:59,797 --> 02:24:01,319
"And, you know, they have this weird thing

3872
02:24:01,319 --> 02:24:03,388
where they get together on some day of the week

3873
02:24:03,389 --> 02:24:05,848
and they sort of swear oaths to one another

3874
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:07,380
not to do bad stuff,"

3875
02:24:07,379 --> 02:24:09,268
which is, of course, his garbled understanding

3876
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:10,919
of the 10 Commandments, you know.

3877
02:24:12,037 --> 02:24:13,620
"And then they have breakfast together,

3878
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:14,670
and they eat food."

3879
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:15,869
And this is communion,

3880
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:19,079
but he doesn't get that that's what's going on.

3881
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:21,599
And so he's really ignorant.

3882
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:23,400
But I think that the broader point is,

3883
02:24:23,399 --> 02:24:26,789
okay, this is one of the best educated,

3884
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:28,979
best traveled Romans

3885
02:24:28,979 --> 02:24:31,139
who has the most experience in the empire,

3886
02:24:31,139 --> 02:24:33,389
has been all over the empire,

3887
02:24:33,389 --> 02:24:35,308
and what does he know about Christianity?

3888
02:24:35,309 --> 02:24:37,259
Basically, nothing.

3889
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:41,429
So if one of the best educated, most widely traveled guys

3890
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:44,340
really doesn't know much about them,

3891
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:45,779
that kind of suggests

3892
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:48,329
that not many people did at this point in time.

3893
02:24:48,329 --> 02:24:50,069
- At this time, it was a fringe movement

3894
02:24:50,069 --> 02:24:51,357
that really did- - Yeah, very fringe.

3895
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:52,889
I mean, it was one of, you know,

3896
02:24:52,889 --> 02:24:54,989
hundreds of little mystery religions,

3897
02:24:54,989 --> 02:24:56,333
the Romans sort of thought on this.

3898
02:24:56,334 --> 02:24:57,167
And these are, you know,

3899
02:24:57,166 --> 02:24:59,488
religions that have some sort of revealed knowledge

3900
02:24:59,489 --> 02:25:03,179
and that make more personal appeals to people.

3901
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:06,599
Now, stepping back from this in a broad way,

3902
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,130
I think you can say that Christianity

3903
02:25:08,129 --> 02:25:10,468
really was different in some ways

3904
02:25:10,469 --> 02:25:12,629
and had some things that maybe the Romans

3905
02:25:12,629 --> 02:25:14,698
should rightfully have viewed as a threat.

3906
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:16,740
I mean, you know, the Romans are people

3907
02:25:16,739 --> 02:25:18,899
very focused on this world, right?

3908
02:25:18,899 --> 02:25:20,609
Citizenship, what you do.

3909
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:24,210
Christianity, in essence, has a focus on the next world.

3910
02:25:24,209 --> 02:25:25,529
So this world isn't as important

3911
02:25:25,530 --> 02:25:27,599
as what you're setting yourself up for.

3912
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,939
And even worse, from a Roman perspective,

3913
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:32,399
I'm kind of saying, okay, if I were a Roman,

3914
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:36,149
Romans are all about making distinctions between people.

3915
02:25:36,149 --> 02:25:38,428
Citizen, non-citizen.

3916
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:39,659
Man, woman.

3917
02:25:39,659 --> 02:25:41,788
Free, slave.

3918
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:43,747
Christianity comes along and says,

3919
02:25:43,746 --> 02:25:47,008
"In God's eyes, you're all equal."

3920
02:25:47,010 --> 02:25:50,219
Now, that's a pretty problematic idea

3921
02:25:50,219 --> 02:25:53,638
if you're deeply invested in Roman hierarchy.

3922
02:25:53,639 --> 02:25:55,949
And I think it is no surprise

3923
02:25:55,950 --> 02:26:00,119
that among the earliest converts to Christianity

3924
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:02,850
are women and slaves,

3925
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:05,609
and in particular female slaves.

3926
02:26:05,610 --> 02:26:06,660
Now, who are they?

3927
02:26:06,659 --> 02:26:08,848
They're the people at the rock bottom

3928
02:26:08,850 --> 02:26:11,580
of the Roman hierarchy of status, right?

3929
02:26:11,579 --> 02:26:13,619
Which the Romans are obsessed with status,

3930
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:16,439
but here's a religion that says that doesn't matter.

3931
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:18,870
And in that same letter to Pliny,

3932
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:20,820
Pliny says, "Okay, in this group of Christians

3933
02:26:20,819 --> 02:26:21,652
I've heard about,

3934
02:26:21,653 --> 02:26:23,879
their leaders are two female slaves

3935
02:26:23,879 --> 02:26:25,829
they call deaconess."

3936
02:26:25,829 --> 02:26:27,419
Now, this is really early.

3937
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:30,330
This is before the church exists, right?

3938
02:26:30,329 --> 02:26:32,579
There's no church structure yet.

3939
02:26:32,579 --> 02:26:35,938
And who is leading the local congregation of Christians?

3940
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:37,232
Two slave women.

3941
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:41,130
So that's an interesting moment, you know.

3942
02:26:41,129 --> 02:26:43,048
And that's not necessarily the image

3943
02:26:43,049 --> 02:26:45,089
we get of early Christianity,

3944
02:26:45,090 --> 02:26:47,159
but you can see how,

3945
02:26:47,159 --> 02:26:49,529
for people in this social structure,

3946
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:51,270
that would be very appealing to them.

3947
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:52,649
And in some ways, yeah,

3948
02:26:52,649 --> 02:26:54,689
it is sort of a threat to the Roman system

3949
02:26:54,690 --> 02:26:56,400
because they're challenging it.

3950
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:57,931
Now, the irony is, of course,

3951
02:26:57,933 --> 02:27:00,929
300 years after the life of Christ,

3952
02:27:00,930 --> 02:27:03,840
the emperor converts to Christianity,

3953
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:05,100
and another hundred years later,

3954
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:05,933
under Theodosius,

3955
02:27:05,933 --> 02:27:09,389
it becomes the official religion of the Roman Empire.

3956
02:27:09,389 --> 02:27:11,038
So all of a sudden, you have this flip flop,

3957
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,290
where now the state itself

3958
02:27:13,290 --> 02:27:15,660
is not just converted to Christianity,

3959
02:27:15,659 --> 02:27:17,938
but actively promoting it

3960
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:20,162
and now persecuting pagans.

3961
02:27:21,239 --> 02:27:24,239
And the reason the emperors do that

3962
02:27:24,239 --> 02:27:26,669
is one of the biggest problems for emperors

3963
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:29,069
at that point in time is legitimacy.

3964
02:27:29,069 --> 02:27:30,718
That there's tons of civil wars

3965
02:27:30,719 --> 02:27:32,885
where you have lots of different people saying,

3966
02:27:32,887 --> 02:27:34,169
"I'm emperor."

3967
02:27:34,170 --> 02:27:37,230
So lots of generals declaring themselves emperor.

3968
02:27:37,229 --> 02:27:41,701
Now, under a polytheistic religion,

3969
02:27:42,629 --> 02:27:44,099
that's just, you're all just fighting.

3970
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:45,329
It doesn't matter.

3971
02:27:45,329 --> 02:27:48,869
But if you say there is only one God,

3972
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:52,680
then if that God picks someone to be his emperor,

3973
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:56,910
they're the only legitimate emperor, right?

3974
02:27:56,909 --> 02:27:59,009
So there is a real advantage

3975
02:27:59,010 --> 02:28:01,650
to emperors now becoming Christian,

3976
02:28:01,649 --> 02:28:03,906
because if they can say,

3977
02:28:03,906 --> 02:28:06,088
"We're now a Christian Empire,

3978
02:28:06,090 --> 02:28:07,650
and there's only one God,

3979
02:28:07,649 --> 02:28:09,928
and I'm the guy that God picked to be emperor,"

3980
02:28:09,930 --> 02:28:11,520
that means all these other people

3981
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:14,100
claiming to be emperors are illegitimate.

3982
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:15,430
- Do you think that,

3983
02:28:15,430 --> 02:28:17,400
or is there other factors that explain

3984
02:28:17,399 --> 02:28:20,309
why Christianity was able to spread?

3985
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:22,469
- Well, I mean, that's why it's appealing to the emperors.

3986
02:28:22,469 --> 02:28:24,569
And we're talking here, you know...

3987
02:28:24,569 --> 02:28:26,939
I mean, the religious answer is

3988
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:28,319
people see the light, right?

3989
02:28:28,319 --> 02:28:29,879
It's a faith-based thing.

3990
02:28:29,879 --> 02:28:32,008
I'm looking at this as a historian.

3991
02:28:32,010 --> 02:28:33,960
So putting aside, you know,

3992
02:28:33,959 --> 02:28:34,866
religious feeling and saying,

3993
02:28:34,867 --> 02:28:37,080
"Okay, if I'm doing an analysis of this

3994
02:28:37,079 --> 02:28:38,518
as a social phenomenon,

3995
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:40,140
what would be appealing to people?"

3996
02:28:40,139 --> 02:28:42,239
And there is that very compelling reason

3997
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:44,848
for emperors to want to go to Christianity

3998
02:28:44,850 --> 02:28:46,890
because it helps 'em with their biggest problem,

3999
02:28:46,889 --> 02:28:48,179
which is legitimacy.

4000
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:50,430
Now, if you're an ordinary person,

4001
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:52,140
what is the appeal of Christianity?

4002
02:28:52,139 --> 02:28:54,239
Well, we already looked at a couple of 'em.

4003
02:28:54,239 --> 02:28:55,349
One of 'em is that, you know,

4004
02:28:55,350 --> 02:28:57,663
it promises you a reward in the afterlife.

4005
02:28:58,799 --> 02:29:01,289
I mean, the Roman and Greek notions of the afterlife

4006
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:02,939
aren't that appealing.

4007
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:04,920
Either you just sort of turn into dust,

4008
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:07,560
or, at best, you turn into this kind of ghost thing

4009
02:29:07,559 --> 02:29:08,879
that floats around something

4010
02:29:08,879 --> 02:29:10,469
that looks like a Greek gymnasium,

4011
02:29:10,469 --> 02:29:12,569
which is like a bunch of grassy fields.

4012
02:29:12,569 --> 02:29:13,831
It's not so hot.

4013
02:29:14,909 --> 02:29:16,356
So here, you're offered the idea of like,

4014
02:29:16,356 --> 02:29:18,089
"Oh, you go to paradise forever."

4015
02:29:18,090 --> 02:29:19,529
That sounds really good.

4016
02:29:19,530 --> 02:29:22,409
And secondly, for a lot of people in Roman society,

4017
02:29:22,409 --> 02:29:24,845
that notion of, here's something that says

4018
02:29:24,846 --> 02:29:26,999
"I'm valuable as a human being.

4019
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,100
It doesn't matter whether I'm free or slave,

4020
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:31,680
it doesn't matter whether I'm Roman or non-Roman,

4021
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:33,420
it doesn't matter if I'm man or woman,

4022
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:35,670
here's something that says I have equal value,"

4023
02:29:35,670 --> 02:29:37,410
that's enormously appealing.

4024
02:29:37,409 --> 02:29:38,578
And finally, early Christians,

4025
02:29:38,579 --> 02:29:39,412
I mean, they honestly,

4026
02:29:39,413 --> 02:29:40,679
a lot of them do good works.

4027
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:42,420
They take care of the sick,

4028
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:43,890
they feed the poor.

4029
02:29:43,889 --> 02:29:45,209
I mean, if you look at Jesus

4030
02:29:45,209 --> 02:29:46,319
and the Sermon on the Mount,

4031
02:29:46,319 --> 02:29:48,479
that's the stuff he really hammers.

4032
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:50,158
If we look at, you know, the words of Jesus

4033
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:51,749
when he says, "What do you do to be a Christian?"

4034
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:54,363
A lot of it is take care of the unfortunate,

4035
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:57,780
you know, take care of people who are sick,

4036
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:00,420
take care of people who are starving.

4037
02:30:00,420 --> 02:30:01,859
And a lot of the early Christians

4038
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:03,450
really take that seriously.

4039
02:30:03,450 --> 02:30:05,729
So they are helping people out,

4040
02:30:05,729 --> 02:30:07,679
so that's appealing.

4041
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,110
- They're are the good kind of populist,

4042
02:30:10,110 --> 02:30:11,943
and populist messages spread.

4043
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:16,498
Let me ask you about gladiators.

4044
02:30:16,498 --> 02:30:19,349
- (laughs) Switch of pace here.

4045
02:30:19,350 --> 02:30:22,713
- What role did they play in Roman society?

4046
02:30:23,940 --> 02:30:25,589
- I mean, okay, gladiator games

4047
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:28,259
has obviously become a popular form of entertainment,

4048
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:29,340
and they're one of the ones

4049
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:31,320
that's captured people's imaginations

4050
02:30:31,319 --> 02:30:32,309
for all sorts of reasons.

4051
02:30:32,309 --> 02:30:33,748
I mean, it's dramatic,

4052
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:36,299
but also I think it's that apparent contradiction

4053
02:30:36,299 --> 02:30:37,259
that in so many ways,

4054
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:40,679
Roman society seems familiar to us,

4055
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:41,520
in so many ways,

4056
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:44,580
it seems sophisticated and appealing,

4057
02:30:44,579 --> 02:30:46,409
law is wonderful, all this,

4058
02:30:46,409 --> 02:30:48,538
but yet, for fun,

4059
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:50,819
they watched people fight to the death.

4060
02:30:50,819 --> 02:30:52,669
So how do you reconcile these things?

4061
02:30:53,909 --> 02:30:56,009
Gladiators, I find very interesting

4062
02:30:56,010 --> 02:30:58,619
because they're an example

4063
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:02,519
of what historians call status dissonance.

4064
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:04,983
So it's someone who, in society,

4065
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:08,879
has high status in some ways

4066
02:31:08,879 --> 02:31:12,149
and very low or despise status in another.

4067
02:31:12,149 --> 02:31:15,539
So gladiators, most of them were slaves.

4068
02:31:15,540 --> 02:31:18,932
The lowest of the low in Roman society, right?

4069
02:31:20,069 --> 02:31:22,769
Also, they're fighting for other people's pleasure,

4070
02:31:22,770 --> 02:31:25,410
and dying sometimes for other people's pleasure.

4071
02:31:25,409 --> 02:31:27,418
And the Romans had a real thing about this,

4072
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:30,690
like your body being used for others' pleasure.

4073
02:31:30,690 --> 02:31:32,579
Even a humble working person

4074
02:31:32,579 --> 02:31:35,038
who hired themself out for labor,

4075
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,379
the Romans thought that was innately demeaning

4076
02:31:37,379 --> 02:31:39,568
because you're using your body

4077
02:31:39,569 --> 02:31:41,488
for someone else's benefit or pleasure.

4078
02:31:41,489 --> 02:31:43,979
So they didn't have this notion of, you know,

4079
02:31:43,979 --> 02:31:46,079
the dignity of hard labor or something.

4080
02:31:46,079 --> 02:31:48,688
They thought the only noble profession was farming, okay?

4081
02:31:48,690 --> 02:31:50,609
'Cause there, you generate something

4082
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:52,080
and you're producing it for yourself,

4083
02:31:52,079 --> 02:31:53,639
but if you work for someone else,

4084
02:31:53,639 --> 02:31:55,169
you're demeaning yourself.

4085
02:31:55,170 --> 02:31:57,299
And gladiators are the worst of the worst, right?

4086
02:31:57,299 --> 02:31:59,968
You're performing for someone else's pleasure.

4087
02:31:59,969 --> 02:32:02,339
So on the one hand, they're very low status,

4088
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:03,810
but on the other hand,

4089
02:32:03,809 --> 02:32:06,268
successful gladiators get famous.

4090
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:08,100
People admire them,

4091
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:09,933
women find them attractive,

4092
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:12,659
you know, they're celebrities.

4093
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:15,359
And so this is the status dissonance, right?

4094
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:17,580
You have these people who, on the one hand,

4095
02:32:17,579 --> 02:32:20,759
formally, are very low status in society,

4096
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:23,550
but yet are very popular, on the other hand.

4097
02:32:23,549 --> 02:32:25,438
Another kind of myth about gladiators

4098
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:28,170
is that they were just dying all the time.

4099
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:30,089
I mean, you watch, you know, movies

4100
02:32:30,090 --> 02:32:32,009
and, again, they'll always throw a bunch of gladiators

4101
02:32:32,010 --> 02:32:33,270
and they all die.

4102
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:35,430
I think some scholar did study of,

4103
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:38,189
there's like a hundred fights we know of

4104
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:40,050
where we know some details,

4105
02:32:40,049 --> 02:32:42,328
and I think 10% of those

4106
02:32:42,329 --> 02:32:44,338
ended in the death of one of the people.

4107
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:48,780
So gladiators are a lot more like boxing matches

4108
02:32:48,780 --> 02:32:51,510
where you're watching a display of skill

4109
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:52,739
between two people

4110
02:32:52,739 --> 02:32:54,719
who are more or less evenly matched

4111
02:32:54,719 --> 02:32:56,638
in terms of their abilities.

4112
02:32:56,639 --> 02:32:58,799
And probably they'll survive,

4113
02:32:58,799 --> 02:33:01,138
though there's a chance that one of them might get injured,

4114
02:33:01,139 --> 02:33:02,492
in fact, one might die.

4115
02:33:04,409 --> 02:33:06,449
Having said all that, in the end,

4116
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:08,760
you really are having people fight

4117
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:09,750
and potentially die

4118
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:11,550
for the pleasure of an audience.

4119
02:33:11,549 --> 02:33:13,828
And anthropologists and Roman historians

4120
02:33:13,829 --> 02:33:16,741
like to speculate why did the Romans do this.

4121
02:33:17,670 --> 02:33:19,170
The Romans address it.

4122
02:33:19,170 --> 02:33:22,566
I mean, there's a famous thing where a Roman says,

4123
02:33:22,566 --> 02:33:24,929
"We, Romans, were a violent people,

4124
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:26,339
we're a warlike people,

4125
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:28,889
and so it's fitting that we should be accustomed

4126
02:33:28,889 --> 02:33:30,776
to the sight of death and violence."

4127
02:33:32,010 --> 02:33:32,943
Kind of works.

4128
02:33:33,989 --> 02:33:37,558
There's a more symbolic interpretation that says

4129
02:33:37,559 --> 02:33:41,608
the amphitheater is an expression of Roman dominance,

4130
02:33:41,610 --> 02:33:43,529
a symbolic expression,

4131
02:33:43,530 --> 02:33:44,520
because what you have

4132
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:47,580
are all segments of Roman society gathered together

4133
02:33:47,579 --> 02:33:50,458
to control the fate of others.

4134
02:33:50,459 --> 02:33:51,959
So you have foreigners,

4135
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:53,219
you have wild animals,

4136
02:33:53,219 --> 02:33:54,839
you have criminals,

4137
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:56,489
you have other people.

4138
02:33:56,489 --> 02:33:59,819
And we are symbolically asserting our dominance

4139
02:33:59,819 --> 02:34:00,929
over those groups

4140
02:34:00,930 --> 02:34:03,809
by determining do you live or do you die?

4141
02:34:03,809 --> 02:34:06,059
And that kind works too.

4142
02:34:06,059 --> 02:34:09,418
And the cynical one is humans like violence.

4143
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:11,879
I mean, when people watch a hockey game,

4144
02:34:11,879 --> 02:34:13,469
what gets the most excited?

4145
02:34:13,469 --> 02:34:14,309
The fight.

4146
02:34:14,309 --> 02:34:16,799
When people watch car racing,

4147
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:17,819
there's a crash,

4148
02:34:17,819 --> 02:34:19,228
what's gonna be shown on the news?

4149
02:34:19,229 --> 02:34:20,638
It's the crash.

4150
02:34:20,639 --> 02:34:23,909
So there's something dark in human nature sometimes

4151
02:34:23,909 --> 02:34:24,959
that likes violence

4152
02:34:24,959 --> 02:34:25,792
and maybe the Romans

4153
02:34:25,792 --> 02:34:28,828
are just being more honest about it than we are.

4154
02:34:28,829 --> 02:34:29,968
- I think Dan Carlin

4155
02:34:29,969 --> 02:34:31,926
has a really great episode called

4156
02:34:31,926 --> 02:34:34,429
"Painfotainment." - Uh-huh.

4157
02:34:34,430 --> 02:34:36,630
- And I think in that episode,

4158
02:34:36,629 --> 02:34:38,038
he suggests a hypothetical

4159
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,620
that if we did something like a gladiator games today

4160
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:41,453
to the death,

4161
02:34:42,299 --> 02:34:44,159
that like the whole world would tune in.

4162
02:34:44,159 --> 02:34:45,009
- [Gregory] Yeah.

4163
02:34:45,930 --> 02:34:47,700
- Especially if it was anonymous, right?

4164
02:34:47,700 --> 02:34:51,030
We have a kind of like thin veil of civility,

4165
02:34:51,030 --> 02:34:53,159
underneath which we probably would still be,

4166
02:34:53,159 --> 02:34:54,239
something deep within us

4167
02:34:54,239 --> 02:34:56,586
would be attracted to that violence.

4168
02:34:56,587 --> 02:34:57,479
- Yeah. I mean, yeah,

4169
02:34:57,479 --> 02:35:00,059
there always, is it human nature?

4170
02:35:00,059 --> 02:35:02,369
You know, why do people slow down when there's a car wreck

4171
02:35:02,370 --> 02:35:04,320
and try and see what's happening?

4172
02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:05,488
On the other hand, to be fair,

4173
02:35:05,489 --> 02:35:07,469
I mean, there were Romans at the time

4174
02:35:07,469 --> 02:35:09,118
who morally objected to them

4175
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:10,680
and said this is, you know,

4176
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:13,439
morally degenerate to take pleasure in this

4177
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:14,550
and that's wrong.

4178
02:35:14,549 --> 02:35:16,499
So I think in all eras,

4179
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:18,060
you have a diversity of opinions.

4180
02:35:18,059 --> 02:35:20,549
There's no unanimous, you know, take on

4181
02:35:20,549 --> 02:35:22,499
on what this is or what this means.

4182
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:25,020
- So who usually were the gladiators?

4183
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:26,370
Was it slaves? Was it...

4184
02:35:26,370 --> 02:35:27,630
- Well, the most common source, again,

4185
02:35:27,629 --> 02:35:29,099
is prisoners of war. - Prisoners.

4186
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:31,530
- So if you conquer some people

4187
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:33,630
and they seem to be warlike,

4188
02:35:33,629 --> 02:35:36,689
you might well consign some of them to fight in the arena.

4189
02:35:36,690 --> 02:35:38,129
And the other thing about gladiators

4190
02:35:38,129 --> 02:35:41,415
is they were highly trained professionals.

4191
02:35:41,416 --> 02:35:44,729
So, you know, the gladiator schools who train them

4192
02:35:44,729 --> 02:35:47,398
were spending a lot of money to train these people.

4193
02:35:47,399 --> 02:35:49,169
And it wasn't just we take some guy

4194
02:35:49,170 --> 02:35:50,490
and throw 'em into the arena

4195
02:35:50,489 --> 02:35:53,339
like you see in movies all the time.

4196
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:55,560
These were people that you'd invested a lot of money in,

4197
02:35:55,559 --> 02:35:58,529
that's why you don't really want to see them killed.

4198
02:35:58,530 --> 02:36:01,530
But yeah, mostly, they're prisoners of war.

4199
02:36:01,530 --> 02:36:03,360
I mean, in very rare instances,

4200
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:05,699
you might have a free person volunteering

4201
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:08,610
or even selling themself to fight as gladiators,

4202
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:11,069
but much more common was that.

4203
02:36:11,069 --> 02:36:14,759
And what's interesting is some people wouldn't do it.

4204
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:16,860
I mean, there's a lot of instances of gladiators

4205
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:19,259
refusing to fight and committing suicide,

4206
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:20,790
which you don't hear.

4207
02:36:20,790 --> 02:36:22,709
So like there was one German

4208
02:36:22,709 --> 02:36:24,809
who was supposed to fight as a gladiator

4209
02:36:24,809 --> 02:36:26,488
and instead he stuck his head

4210
02:36:26,489 --> 02:36:29,038
between the spokes of a wagon that was spinning

4211
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:31,140
and snapped his own neck.

4212
02:36:31,139 --> 02:36:32,879
There were a group of 29 Germans

4213
02:36:32,879 --> 02:36:33,786
who all sort of said,

4214
02:36:33,787 --> 02:36:35,879
"We're not gonna fight for the Romans pleasure,"

4215
02:36:35,879 --> 02:36:37,379
and they strangled one another

4216
02:36:37,379 --> 02:36:40,258
the night before they were supposed to fight.

4217
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:42,809
So I mean, you have people sort of objecting

4218
02:36:42,809 --> 02:36:47,156
to being complicit in this kind of performance as well.

4219
02:36:47,156 --> 02:36:50,369
- And they also had interest in animals.

4220
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:51,203
- Yes.

4221
02:36:51,202 --> 02:36:53,609
- So humans fought animals.

4222
02:36:53,610 --> 02:36:54,510
Exotic animals.

4223
02:36:54,510 --> 02:36:56,429
- And animals fought animals. - Animals fought animals.

4224
02:36:56,430 --> 02:36:58,140
- Yeah, the Romans were a little weird

4225
02:36:58,139 --> 02:36:58,972
with their animal thing.

4226
02:36:58,972 --> 02:37:00,599
They loved exotic animals,

4227
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:03,809
but mostly they liked to see the exotic animals die.

4228
02:37:03,809 --> 02:37:07,318
So I mean, there was an enormous industry

4229
02:37:07,319 --> 02:37:09,629
collecting wild beasts,

4230
02:37:09,629 --> 02:37:11,249
transporting them to Rome,

4231
02:37:11,250 --> 02:37:12,540
which is no easy matter

4232
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:14,490
to transport elephants

4233
02:37:14,489 --> 02:37:16,349
and giraffes and rhinos,

4234
02:37:16,350 --> 02:37:18,689
particularly in, you know, this era of technology.

4235
02:37:18,690 --> 02:37:21,660
But they were like draining Africa

4236
02:37:21,659 --> 02:37:23,548
and bringing lions and all these things

4237
02:37:23,549 --> 02:37:25,198
and sacrificing them.

4238
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,670
- And what about the different venues?

4239
02:37:26,670 --> 02:37:28,858
I mean, there's the legendary Colosseum.

4240
02:37:28,858 --> 02:37:32,490
What is the importance of this place?

4241
02:37:32,489 --> 02:37:33,628
- Well, the Colosseum,

4242
02:37:33,629 --> 02:37:35,999
it's real name is the Flavian Amphitheater,

4243
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,330
is interesting because, for a long time,

4244
02:37:38,331 --> 02:37:40,560
Rome always had a chariot racing arena,

4245
02:37:40,559 --> 02:37:41,579
the Circus Maximus,

4246
02:37:41,579 --> 02:37:44,668
but it didn't have a permanent gladiatorial venue

4247
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:48,449
until relatively late, 'til about 80 AD.

4248
02:37:48,450 --> 02:37:51,840
So during the reign of the Emperor Vespasian.

4249
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:53,880
And he built this thing.

4250
02:37:53,879 --> 02:37:55,528
So he built the Flavian Amphitheater,

4251
02:37:55,530 --> 02:37:57,480
he was from the Flavian family of emperors,

4252
02:37:57,479 --> 02:38:02,248
and he did it as a deliberate act of propaganda.

4253
02:38:02,250 --> 02:38:05,310
So before him had been Nero,

4254
02:38:05,309 --> 02:38:07,858
who was, sources are saying,

4255
02:38:07,860 --> 02:38:10,170
crazy or bad emperor.

4256
02:38:10,170 --> 02:38:12,390
And one of Nero's indulgences

4257
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:15,089
is he had built this enormous palace for himself

4258
02:38:15,090 --> 02:38:16,890
called the Golden House.

4259
02:38:16,889 --> 02:38:18,778
So it was kind of this pleasure palace

4260
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:21,510
with 50 dining rooms and all this stuff.

4261
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:25,349
And it was basically wasting a ton of money on him, right?

4262
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:29,519
So right on the site where Nero had his Golden House,

4263
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:33,450
Vespasian says, "I'm gonna erect a new building on top of it

4264
02:38:33,450 --> 02:38:35,940
that's gonna be for the pleasure of the people."

4265
02:38:35,940 --> 02:38:37,740
So it was very much a political statement

4266
02:38:37,739 --> 02:38:41,308
that my dynasty is gonna be about serving Romans,

4267
02:38:41,309 --> 02:38:43,349
not serving ourselves.

4268
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:46,830
And so that's why he builds the Flavian Amphitheater.

4269
02:38:46,829 --> 02:38:48,599
And the funds he uses from it

4270
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:51,419
is basically from looting Jerusalem.

4271
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:53,400
Because the other thing he had done just before this

4272
02:38:53,399 --> 02:38:54,929
is he had sacked Jerusalem

4273
02:38:54,930 --> 02:38:57,479
and destroyed the temple there, in fact.

4274
02:38:57,479 --> 02:38:59,608
He and his son Titus.

4275
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:02,250
And so this is what he now builds in Rome

4276
02:39:02,250 --> 02:39:04,890
is his gift to the people of Rome.

4277
02:39:04,889 --> 02:39:07,648
- But it's interesting to think about that place,

4278
02:39:07,649 --> 02:39:09,704
to think about their relationship with violence

4279
02:39:09,704 --> 02:39:12,838
across centuries

4280
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:15,210
for spectacle, watching people fight.

4281
02:39:15,209 --> 02:39:17,069
And like you said, you know,

4282
02:39:17,069 --> 02:39:20,129
only like 10% of the time it led to the death,

4283
02:39:20,129 --> 02:39:25,129
but I read that still a lot of people died,

4284
02:39:25,170 --> 02:39:26,940
a lot of gladiators were killed.

4285
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:28,089
- Oh yeah. - There's numbers are...

4286
02:39:28,090 --> 02:39:29,160
It is crazy, I mean.

4287
02:39:29,159 --> 02:39:33,119
I read a 400,000 dead.

4288
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:34,740
So this includes gladiators, slaves,

4289
02:39:34,739 --> 02:39:37,888
convicts, prisoners, and so on.

4290
02:39:37,889 --> 02:39:39,118
That's a lot of people.

4291
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:41,220
- The Flavian Amphitheater is really interesting too

4292
02:39:41,219 --> 02:39:42,929
just as a piece of technology

4293
02:39:42,930 --> 02:39:45,300
and as influence on later world.

4294
02:39:45,299 --> 02:39:48,209
I mean, almost every sporting arena today

4295
02:39:48,209 --> 02:39:50,249
owes something to the Flavian Amphitheater,

4296
02:39:50,250 --> 02:39:52,680
Colosseum, in terms of construction.

4297
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:55,229
And it was amazingly sophisticated building.

4298
02:39:55,229 --> 02:39:57,418
I mean, it had, you know, retractable awnings

4299
02:39:57,420 --> 02:39:59,040
and elevators and ramps

4300
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:02,339
that things could just pop up into the arena from below.

4301
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:06,210
And, you know, it had very well designed passages

4302
02:40:06,209 --> 02:40:09,059
where everybody could file in and file out very efficiently,

4303
02:40:09,059 --> 02:40:10,529
and they were all numbered.

4304
02:40:10,530 --> 02:40:11,969
So, I mean, it's one of, I think,

4305
02:40:11,969 --> 02:40:14,998
the most influential buildings in history

4306
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,830
just because of the way that, you know,

4307
02:40:16,829 --> 02:40:18,329
all these buildings we go to today,

4308
02:40:18,329 --> 02:40:19,829
they're all kind of variants on it

4309
02:40:19,829 --> 02:40:22,349
and using some of the ideas from it.

4310
02:40:22,350 --> 02:40:25,499
- And the Romans took their construction seriously.

4311
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:26,333
- Oh yeah, they were good at that.

4312
02:40:26,333 --> 02:40:28,502
So they were excellent engineers.

4313
02:40:29,399 --> 02:40:31,229
And the Romans were excellent engineers,

4314
02:40:31,229 --> 02:40:32,398
especially when it came to

4315
02:40:32,399 --> 02:40:34,528
what you might think of as humble stuff.

4316
02:40:34,530 --> 02:40:35,850
I mean, today we tend to think of,

4317
02:40:35,850 --> 02:40:38,879
oh, a Roman building is shining white marble, right?

4318
02:40:38,879 --> 02:40:41,519
Well, the core of that building was probably concrete

4319
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:44,189
and the marble is just a superficial facade.

4320
02:40:44,190 --> 02:40:47,009
And if you think about the Colosseum in Rome today,

4321
02:40:47,010 --> 02:40:49,349
all the marble has been stripped off that building

4322
02:40:49,350 --> 02:40:51,419
and what you see is the concrete core,

4323
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:53,730
the structural core that's left.

4324
02:40:53,729 --> 02:40:56,639
And the Romans, I mean, they didn't invent concrete,

4325
02:40:56,639 --> 02:40:58,708
but they just used it more creatively

4326
02:40:58,709 --> 02:41:00,209
than anyone had before.

4327
02:41:00,209 --> 02:41:02,309
And if you look at buildings like the Greeks built,

4328
02:41:02,309 --> 02:41:03,448
they're all rectilinear,

4329
02:41:03,450 --> 02:41:05,430
they're all rectangles or squares,

4330
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:07,559
and they always have a lot of columns

4331
02:41:07,559 --> 02:41:09,509
because you need to hold the roof up.

4332
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:12,510
The Romans, because of their use of concrete,

4333
02:41:12,510 --> 02:41:14,250
could build wooden frames,

4334
02:41:14,250 --> 02:41:15,240
they could have curves,

4335
02:41:15,239 --> 02:41:16,139
they could have domes,

4336
02:41:16,139 --> 02:41:17,759
they could have all kinds of stuff.

4337
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:21,809
And it just explodes the architectural possibilities.

4338
02:41:21,809 --> 02:41:24,268
They also made a lot of use of the vault.

4339
02:41:24,270 --> 02:41:26,490
So if you cut rocks and arrange them

4340
02:41:26,489 --> 02:41:27,599
so they form a curve,

4341
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:29,669
you could have big vaulted spaces.

4342
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:31,523
And they were just brilliant with their mix of things.

4343
02:41:31,522 --> 02:41:35,009
I mean, the Pantheon is the best preserved Roman building,

4344
02:41:35,010 --> 02:41:36,750
and it's another brilliant building,

4345
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:38,250
incredibly influential.

4346
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:41,009
I mean, every capitol building in the world

4347
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:44,070
or museum is an imitation of the Pantheon.

4348
02:41:44,069 --> 02:41:46,528
You know, the capitol in Washington, D.C.,

4349
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:48,480
the capitol in Madison, I'm from Wisconsin,

4350
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:49,708
Austin, where we are now,

4351
02:41:49,709 --> 02:41:51,056
they're all Pantheons.

4352
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:53,128
You know, it's a big dome

4353
02:41:53,129 --> 02:41:54,568
with a triangular pediment

4354
02:41:54,569 --> 02:41:56,069
and some columns on the front.

4355
02:41:57,059 --> 02:41:59,128
So it's just amazingly influential building,

4356
02:41:59,129 --> 02:42:00,358
but it's brilliant,

4357
02:42:00,360 --> 02:42:01,747
because the way it's constructed is,

4358
02:42:01,746 --> 02:42:04,319
you know, the concrete at the bottom of the dome

4359
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:07,859
is both thicker and has a denser formulation.

4360
02:42:07,860 --> 02:42:10,380
So it's heavier where it needs to bear the weight.

4361
02:42:10,379 --> 02:42:12,179
And then as you get further up the dome,

4362
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:13,680
it gets narrower and narrower

4363
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:16,439
and they mix in different types of rock.

4364
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:18,180
So at the top, you're using pumice,

4365
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:20,069
that very light volcanic stone.

4366
02:42:20,069 --> 02:42:22,348
So where you want it to be light, it's light.

4367
02:42:22,350 --> 02:42:24,359
And it's here 2000 years later.

4368
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:25,193
I mean, look around you.

4369
02:42:25,192 --> 02:42:26,669
How many buildings that we're building now

4370
02:42:26,670 --> 02:42:29,360
do you think are gonna be here in 2000 years?

4371
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:31,799
I suspect not many.

4372
02:42:31,799 --> 02:42:33,448
- And it's not only that they lasted,

4373
02:42:33,450 --> 02:42:34,589
but they were beautiful,

4374
02:42:34,590 --> 02:42:37,380
or at least in our current conception of beauty.

4375
02:42:37,379 --> 02:42:39,448
- Yeah, I mean, you know, Vitruvius,

4376
02:42:39,450 --> 02:42:41,459
you know, his principles are things should be functional

4377
02:42:41,459 --> 02:42:43,528
and they should be aesthetically pleasing.

4378
02:42:43,530 --> 02:42:46,050
So that's a winning combination, I think.

4379
02:42:46,049 --> 02:42:48,328
- Yeah, they pulled that off pretty well.

4380
02:42:48,329 --> 02:42:51,329
If you could talk about the long line of emperors

4381
02:42:51,329 --> 02:42:53,518
that made up the Roman Empire,

4382
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:55,830
how were they selected?

4383
02:42:55,829 --> 02:42:57,329
- Oh boy, this is,

4384
02:42:57,329 --> 02:43:00,208
we've been talking about Augustus's great achievements

4385
02:43:00,209 --> 02:43:02,488
and how clever he was with propaganda and all,

4386
02:43:02,489 --> 02:43:05,189
this is his great failure.

4387
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:08,190
So his great failure is that he did not solve

4388
02:43:08,190 --> 02:43:10,199
was the problem of succession.

4389
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:13,170
How do you ensure that the next person who follows you

4390
02:43:13,170 --> 02:43:15,299
is not just the best person

4391
02:43:15,299 --> 02:43:16,591
but is qualified?

4392
02:43:17,430 --> 02:43:18,990
And he fails to do it.

4393
02:43:18,989 --> 02:43:22,018
So the principle he settles on is heredity.

4394
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:23,970
So the nearest blood relative.

4395
02:43:23,969 --> 02:43:25,198
And he goes through all these people.

4396
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:27,269
All these young kids in his family die.

4397
02:43:27,270 --> 02:43:28,949
He keeps trying to make the heir.

4398
02:43:28,950 --> 02:43:31,320
And he ends up making his heir Tiberius,

4399
02:43:31,319 --> 02:43:32,369
who he never liked.

4400
02:43:32,370 --> 02:43:34,590
It was his stepson, he didn't like him,

4401
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:35,910
but he ends up inheriting it.

4402
02:43:35,909 --> 02:43:39,301
And the next set of emperors, the Julio-Claudian,

4403
02:43:40,139 --> 02:43:42,089
which is the family that Augusta starts,

4404
02:43:42,090 --> 02:43:45,570
they all basically are who is the nearest male relative

4405
02:43:45,569 --> 02:43:47,309
to the previous emperor.

4406
02:43:47,309 --> 02:43:49,619
And that's how he get a lot of crazy emperors

4407
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:51,453
like Caligula or Nero.

4408
02:43:53,190 --> 02:43:55,376
And then the next family, the Flavian,

4409
02:43:55,377 --> 02:43:57,510
the first guy is kind of an Augustus.

4410
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:58,343
It's Vespasian,

4411
02:43:58,343 --> 02:44:00,359
the one who builds the Flavian Amphitheater.

4412
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:02,190
And then one of his sons takes over,

4413
02:44:02,190 --> 02:44:03,300
Titus, who's okay,

4414
02:44:03,299 --> 02:44:04,589
and then the next son takes over,

4415
02:44:04,590 --> 02:44:06,360
Domitian, who's nuts again.

4416
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:09,330
So heredity just isn't working.

4417
02:44:09,329 --> 02:44:11,549
And Rome fights a couple civil wars,

4418
02:44:11,549 --> 02:44:12,591
and in 98 AD,

4419
02:44:13,469 --> 02:44:15,808
we're a hundred years now into the empire,

4420
02:44:15,809 --> 02:44:17,916
and they look back at this track record and say,

4421
02:44:17,916 --> 02:44:20,848
"Okay, we've been picking our emperors by heredity

4422
02:44:20,850 --> 02:44:21,780
and it's been a,

4423
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:23,580
we've gotten some real duds here,

4424
02:44:23,579 --> 02:44:25,679
some real problematic people.

4425
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:27,689
Is there a way to fix this?"

4426
02:44:27,690 --> 02:44:29,339
And this is one of the few instances

4427
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:30,810
where the Romans, who I keep saying,

4428
02:44:30,809 --> 02:44:33,029
are very traditional and resist change,

4429
02:44:33,030 --> 02:44:34,770
I think actually make a change

4430
02:44:34,770 --> 02:44:37,016
and realize, we gotta do something different.

4431
02:44:37,016 --> 02:44:38,976
And so the next guy looks around and says,

4432
02:44:38,977 --> 02:44:42,509
"Okay, forget who's my nearest male relative,

4433
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:46,590
who's the best qualified to be emperor after me?

4434
02:44:46,590 --> 02:44:47,789
I'll pick that person

4435
02:44:47,790 --> 02:44:49,799
and then I'll adopt him as my son."

4436
02:44:49,799 --> 02:44:51,716
So they kind of stick with the heredity,

4437
02:44:51,718 --> 02:44:53,759
but now it's this fake adoption.

4438
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:56,159
And you end up with a lot of old guys

4439
02:44:56,159 --> 02:44:59,009
adopting middle aged adults as their son,

4440
02:44:59,010 --> 02:45:01,710
which is a little strange, but it works.

4441
02:45:01,709 --> 02:45:04,019
And so for the next 80 years,

4442
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:05,550
you have only five emperors,

4443
02:45:05,549 --> 02:45:08,489
and they're often called the five good emperors.

4444
02:45:08,489 --> 02:45:10,768
They're not related necessarily by blood,

4445
02:45:10,770 --> 02:45:12,659
they sort of pick the best qualified guy,

4446
02:45:12,659 --> 02:45:16,529
and they're all sound, competent, good emperors.

4447
02:45:16,530 --> 02:45:18,120
And the 2nd century AD

4448
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:21,539
from Nerva to Marcus Aurelius

4449
02:45:21,540 --> 02:45:23,429
is often regarded as the high point

4450
02:45:23,430 --> 02:45:24,750
of the Roman Empire.

4451
02:45:24,750 --> 02:45:26,280
And a lot of that comes from,

4452
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:28,050
you have political stability,

4453
02:45:28,049 --> 02:45:31,558
you have a succession of decent guys being emperor,

4454
02:45:31,559 --> 02:45:33,628
who rule relatively wisely,

4455
02:45:33,629 --> 02:45:35,008
promote good policies.

4456
02:45:35,010 --> 02:45:37,260
There's other things working to Rome's advantage,

4457
02:45:37,260 --> 02:45:38,459
but that's good.

4458
02:45:38,459 --> 02:45:41,699
And then where it falls apart is where the last guy.

4459
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:43,729
Marcus Aurelius looks around and says,

4460
02:45:43,729 --> 02:45:47,039
"Hmm, who's the best qualified guy to succeed me?

4461
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:48,390
Ah, what a coincidence.

4462
02:45:48,389 --> 02:45:50,668
It's my own dear son,"

4463
02:45:50,670 --> 02:45:52,260
who turns out to be a psycho.

4464
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,850
And then it all goes downhill.

4465
02:45:53,850 --> 02:45:56,490
- And some people place the,

4466
02:45:56,489 --> 02:45:58,709
sort of the collapse of the Roman Empire there

4467
02:45:58,709 --> 02:45:59,981
at the end of Marcus Aurelius rule.

4468
02:45:59,983 --> 02:46:03,749
- Yep. Yeah, so 180 AD is one common date for,

4469
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:06,886
an early date for the end of the Roman Empire,

4470
02:46:06,886 --> 02:46:07,719
'cause from then on,

4471
02:46:07,718 --> 02:46:11,549
it's a mixed bag of good and bad emperors.

4472
02:46:11,549 --> 02:46:14,578
- At the very least, this period is when it,

4473
02:46:14,579 --> 02:46:16,648
the Roman Empire is at its height

4474
02:46:16,649 --> 02:46:18,689
on all different kinds of perspectives.

4475
02:46:18,690 --> 02:46:20,339
- Certainly, geographically.

4476
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:21,173
I mean, at this point,

4477
02:46:21,173 --> 02:46:23,520
it stretches from Britain to Mesopotamia,

4478
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:25,529
from Egypt up to Germany.

4479
02:46:25,530 --> 02:46:27,449
You know, like I said, probably about 50 million people

4480
02:46:27,450 --> 02:46:28,619
within its boundaries.

4481
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:31,620
Within those boundaries, there's relative peace.

4482
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:34,439
So I mean, sometimes people talk about the Pax Romana.

4483
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:36,240
I mean, the Romans are fighting lots of people,

4484
02:46:36,239 --> 02:46:38,939
but within the boundaries, you have relative peace.

4485
02:46:38,940 --> 02:46:41,730
There's relative economic prosperity.

4486
02:46:41,729 --> 02:46:42,809
I mean, nothing in the ancient world

4487
02:46:42,809 --> 02:46:44,008
is that prosperous.

4488
02:46:44,010 --> 02:46:46,170
It's just a different sort of economy.

4489
02:46:46,170 --> 02:46:47,100
But it's pretty stable.

4490
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:50,189
There's no huge disasters happening yet.

4491
02:46:50,190 --> 02:46:52,713
Some plague start in Marcus Aurelius's reign.

4492
02:46:53,790 --> 02:46:56,069
But yeah, this is pretty much seen

4493
02:46:56,069 --> 02:46:57,298
as the high point of the Roman Empire,

4494
02:46:57,299 --> 02:46:58,229
and I think it is.

4495
02:46:58,229 --> 02:47:00,332
I think that there's truth to that.

4496
02:47:01,469 --> 02:47:04,319
- Let me ask the ridiculously oversimplified question,

4497
02:47:04,319 --> 02:47:06,778
but who do you think are,

4498
02:47:06,780 --> 02:47:09,331
is the greatest Roman emperor?

4499
02:47:09,331 --> 02:47:12,914
Or maybe your top three. - Greatest emperor?

4500
02:47:14,430 --> 02:47:15,263
I tell you what,

4501
02:47:15,263 --> 02:47:17,880
I'll tell you my favorite Roman

4502
02:47:17,879 --> 02:47:19,528
who wasn't an emperor,

4503
02:47:19,530 --> 02:47:21,809
and that's Marcus Agrippa,

4504
02:47:21,809 --> 02:47:25,708
who was Augustus's right hand man.

4505
02:47:25,709 --> 02:47:27,898
So Agrippa is this interesting guy

4506
02:47:27,899 --> 02:47:29,308
who is extremely talented.

4507
02:47:29,309 --> 02:47:30,569
He's a terrific general.

4508
02:47:30,569 --> 02:47:32,008
He's a terrific admiral.

4509
02:47:32,010 --> 02:47:33,840
He's a great builder.

4510
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:36,090
He, you know, is kind of like

4511
02:47:36,090 --> 02:47:37,920
the troubleshooter for Augustus.

4512
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:40,410
He's the guy who wins the Battle of Actium for Augustus.

4513
02:47:40,409 --> 02:47:41,242
So literally,

4514
02:47:41,243 --> 02:47:42,930
Augustus would not have become the first emperor

4515
02:47:42,930 --> 02:47:44,550
without Agrippa.

4516
02:47:44,549 --> 02:47:46,919
When Augustus rebuilds the city of Rome,

4517
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:48,359
it's Agrippa that he gives the job.

4518
02:47:48,360 --> 02:47:50,279
To Agrippa rebuilds the Campus Martius.

4519
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:52,230
He builds the first version of the Pantheon.

4520
02:47:52,229 --> 02:47:55,442
He personally goes through the sewers to clean them out.

4521
02:47:56,729 --> 02:47:59,309
And he just has this great set of qualities

4522
02:47:59,309 --> 02:48:01,374
that he's very self-effacing.

4523
02:48:01,376 --> 02:48:02,940
You know, I think he likes power.

4524
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:05,467
He wants real power, but he realizes,

4525
02:48:05,467 --> 02:48:08,879
"I don't have that kind of clever politician's ability

4526
02:48:08,879 --> 02:48:10,528
to be the front guy,

4527
02:48:10,530 --> 02:48:13,500
so I'll just serve my friend, Augustus, loyally."

4528
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:15,217
They were childhood friends.

4529
02:48:15,217 --> 02:48:17,970
"I'll win the battles for Augustus,

4530
02:48:17,969 --> 02:48:19,978
and I'll let him take all the credit,

4531
02:48:19,979 --> 02:48:21,959
but I'll be his number two guy,

4532
02:48:21,959 --> 02:48:23,219
and that's what I'm good at."

4533
02:48:23,219 --> 02:48:25,379
And he realizes his limitations.

4534
02:48:25,379 --> 02:48:26,726
I mean, so many people don't,

4535
02:48:26,727 --> 02:48:27,560
so many people are like,

4536
02:48:27,559 --> 02:48:29,039
"Oh, I just wanna keep, you know,

4537
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:31,049
grabbing for more and more and more,"

4538
02:48:31,049 --> 02:48:33,029
when it's not something they're good at.

4539
02:48:33,030 --> 02:48:35,730
And I think Agrippa says, "I'm good to this point,

4540
02:48:35,729 --> 02:48:37,589
and I'll play that role, and no more,

4541
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:39,450
and that'll gimme a lot of power,

4542
02:48:39,450 --> 02:48:41,700
but I'm not gonna press it."

4543
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:44,849
And he's, yeah, he's just very hardworking.

4544
02:48:44,850 --> 02:48:47,249
He's modest, he's self-effacing.

4545
02:48:47,250 --> 02:48:48,990
He's highly competent.

4546
02:48:48,989 --> 02:48:51,509
- I wonder how many people in history there are

4547
02:48:51,510 --> 02:48:52,800
that are like the drivers,

4548
02:48:52,799 --> 02:48:54,928
the COO of the whole operation

4549
02:48:54,930 --> 02:48:56,309
that we don't really think about

4550
02:48:56,309 --> 02:48:58,619
or don't talk about enough

4551
02:48:58,620 --> 02:49:00,180
to where sort of,

4552
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:02,519
they're really the mastermind.

4553
02:49:02,520 --> 02:49:04,290
- Or the ones who make something possible.

4554
02:49:04,290 --> 02:49:05,880
I mean, even this conversation today,

4555
02:49:05,879 --> 02:49:07,589
you would not have Alexander the Great

4556
02:49:07,590 --> 02:49:09,210
without his father, Philip II,

4557
02:49:09,209 --> 02:49:10,679
having built that army

4558
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:12,663
and handed it to him on silver platter.

4559
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:16,443
Octavian would never have become emperor without Agrippa.

4560
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:20,460
So they play central roles sometimes.

4561
02:49:20,459 --> 02:49:21,539
But if I had to pick an emperor,

4562
02:49:21,540 --> 02:49:23,970
I'd probably pick Augustus

4563
02:49:23,969 --> 02:49:25,888
just because of his influence.

4564
02:49:25,889 --> 02:49:28,348
And because I admire his,

4565
02:49:28,350 --> 02:49:29,277
the thing Agrippa didn't have,

4566
02:49:29,277 --> 02:49:30,900
his political savvy,

4567
02:49:30,899 --> 02:49:33,419
his manipulation of image and propaganda,

4568
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:35,969
all that I find very fascinating.

4569
02:49:35,969 --> 02:49:39,328
Though I'm not sure he's a great human being,

4570
02:49:39,329 --> 02:49:41,957
but he's a really interesting figure.

4571
02:49:41,958 --> 02:49:44,579
- Whether he's good or bad,

4572
02:49:44,579 --> 02:49:46,739
he was extremely influential

4573
02:49:46,739 --> 02:49:49,589
on defining just the entirety

4574
02:49:49,590 --> 02:49:51,479
of human history that followed.

4575
02:49:51,479 --> 02:49:54,272
Yeah, probably one of the most influential humans ever.

4576
02:49:55,319 --> 02:49:58,919
Nevertheless, if you ask in public

4577
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:00,750
who the most famous Roman emperor is,

4578
02:50:00,750 --> 02:50:03,509
would that be Marcus Aurelius, potentially?

4579
02:50:03,510 --> 02:50:05,010
- I don't know.

4580
02:50:05,010 --> 02:50:06,108
- But he's up there, right? - That's a good question.

4581
02:50:06,108 --> 02:50:09,090
- He's real famous because he was a stoic philosopher

4582
02:50:09,090 --> 02:50:10,890
and he wrote this book, "The Meditations."

4583
02:50:10,889 --> 02:50:11,909
- I mean, it's just interesting.

4584
02:50:11,909 --> 02:50:15,478
Stoicism had, as a philosophical ideology,

4585
02:50:15,479 --> 02:50:18,719
had a role to play in during that time.

4586
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:21,959
I mean, there's the tragic fact that...

4587
02:50:21,959 --> 02:50:25,022
Well, did Nero murder Seneca?

4588
02:50:26,010 --> 02:50:26,880
- Yes.

4589
02:50:26,879 --> 02:50:29,459
Well, he drove him to suicide, let's say.

4590
02:50:29,459 --> 02:50:31,243
- There's a lot of interesting questions there,

4591
02:50:31,244 --> 02:50:33,300
but one is like the role,

4592
02:50:33,299 --> 02:50:35,839
especially when it's hereditary,

4593
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:37,680
the role of the mentor,

4594
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:38,853
like who advises who?

4595
02:50:38,852 --> 02:50:41,879
With the Aristotle and- - Yeah.

4596
02:50:41,879 --> 02:50:42,712
- Alexander the Great,

4597
02:50:42,712 --> 02:50:47,712
like that dance of who influences and guides the person

4598
02:50:47,909 --> 02:50:50,728
as they gain power is really interesting.

4599
02:50:50,729 --> 02:50:52,079
- Well, I mean, one of the big questions

4600
02:50:52,079 --> 02:50:53,159
with the Roman emperors,

4601
02:50:53,159 --> 02:50:54,358
and we've been talking about some of 'em,

4602
02:50:54,360 --> 02:50:59,129
is why did so many seem to be either crazy

4603
02:50:59,129 --> 02:51:00,692
or just kind of sadist?

4604
02:51:01,649 --> 02:51:02,699
And that's...

4605
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:04,200
I don't know that there's a good answer to that.

4606
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,280
I mean, people have theories.

4607
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:07,469
Oh, you know, Caligula got a brain fever

4608
02:51:07,469 --> 02:51:09,419
and changed after that or something.

4609
02:51:09,420 --> 02:51:13,230
But I think there's a lot of maybe truth

4610
02:51:13,229 --> 02:51:16,619
in the notion that the ones who seem to go craziest

4611
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:19,829
quite often are the ones who become emperor at a young age.

4612
02:51:19,829 --> 02:51:21,898
And there is something about that old cliche

4613
02:51:21,899 --> 02:51:24,718
that absolute power corrupts absolutely,

4614
02:51:24,719 --> 02:51:27,089
especially if your own personality

4615
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:28,710
isn't really fully formed yet.

4616
02:51:28,709 --> 02:51:29,662
You know what I'm saying?

4617
02:51:29,663 --> 02:51:32,520
I mean, I think take anybody when they're a teenager.

4618
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:33,780
If you all of a sudden said,

4619
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:35,580
you have unlimited power,

4620
02:51:35,579 --> 02:51:37,199
you know, what would that do to you?

4621
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:38,910
How would that warp your personality?

4622
02:51:38,909 --> 02:51:40,058
I mean, look at all the,

4623
02:51:40,059 --> 02:51:40,892
what do they always have today,

4624
02:51:40,893 --> 02:51:41,790
like the Disney stars

4625
02:51:41,790 --> 02:51:43,320
who sort of go wrong or something

4626
02:51:43,319 --> 02:51:44,789
because they get rich and famous

4627
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:46,140
at this very young age.

4628
02:51:46,139 --> 02:51:49,648
- Yeah. Fame, power, and even money,

4629
02:51:49,649 --> 02:51:51,968
if you get way too much of it at a young age.

4630
02:51:51,969 --> 02:51:55,259
- Yeah. - I think we're egotistical,

4631
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:56,093
narcissistic,

4632
02:51:56,093 --> 02:51:57,663
all that kind of stuff as babies.

4633
02:51:58,799 --> 02:52:01,016
And then when we clash with the world

4634
02:52:01,016 --> 02:52:03,508
and we figure out the morality of the world,

4635
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:05,250
how to interact with others,

4636
02:52:05,250 --> 02:52:07,529
that other people suffer in all kinds of ways,

4637
02:52:07,530 --> 02:52:11,280
understand like the cruelty, the beauty of the world,

4638
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:14,460
the fact that other people suffer in different ways,

4639
02:52:14,459 --> 02:52:16,229
the fact that other people are also human

4640
02:52:16,229 --> 02:52:17,279
and have different perspectives,

4641
02:52:17,280 --> 02:52:20,190
all of that, in order to develop that,

4642
02:52:20,190 --> 02:52:22,620
you shouldn't be blocked off from the world,

4643
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:25,229
which power and money and fame can do.

4644
02:52:25,229 --> 02:52:26,699
- And conversely, a lot of the emperors

4645
02:52:26,700 --> 02:52:28,680
we regard as, you know, "good emperors"

4646
02:52:28,680 --> 02:52:30,716
are the ones who become emperor at a,

4647
02:52:30,717 --> 02:52:33,479
you know, middle aged or something,

4648
02:52:33,479 --> 02:52:35,429
where their personalities are fully formed,

4649
02:52:35,430 --> 02:52:38,370
where they're not gonna really become different people.

4650
02:52:38,370 --> 02:52:41,470
And so that works in that theory too.

4651
02:52:41,470 --> 02:52:42,599
I mean, I don't think it's absolute,

4652
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:46,260
and of course the greatest exception is Octavian Augustus,

4653
02:52:46,260 --> 02:52:49,440
who, you know, starts his rise to power as a teenager,

4654
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:51,989
somehow doesn't seem to go nuts.

4655
02:52:51,989 --> 02:52:54,025
- Yeah. History has a lot- - It's not an absolute,

4656
02:52:54,027 --> 02:52:56,459
but it doesn't help to get that much power

4657
02:52:56,459 --> 02:52:58,648
at a young age, I think.

4658
02:52:58,649 --> 02:53:00,629
- What does it take to be a successful emperor,

4659
02:53:00,629 --> 02:53:01,559
would you say?

4660
02:53:01,559 --> 02:53:03,659
- So you say, what does it take

4661
02:53:03,659 --> 02:53:04,709
to be a good Roman emperor?

4662
02:53:04,709 --> 02:53:07,058
You know, if you were gonna draw up a,

4663
02:53:07,058 --> 02:53:08,519
you know, a job description

4664
02:53:08,520 --> 02:53:09,929
seeking Roman emperor,

4665
02:53:09,930 --> 02:53:12,030
what are the qualities and qualifications

4666
02:53:12,030 --> 02:53:13,030
you would put on it?

4667
02:53:14,069 --> 02:53:15,268
Obviously, you would put,

4668
02:53:15,270 --> 02:53:16,830
you know, responsible,

4669
02:53:16,829 --> 02:53:18,599
good understanding of military,

4670
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:20,999
economics, whatever, ability to delegate.

4671
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:22,649
But just to be fun,

4672
02:53:22,649 --> 02:53:25,738
let's consider how much does it matter

4673
02:53:25,739 --> 02:53:28,319
whether the emperor is good or bad?

4674
02:53:28,319 --> 02:53:30,388
Because in the ancient world,

4675
02:53:30,389 --> 02:53:32,429
what does it affect really

4676
02:53:32,430 --> 02:53:36,240
if you're, say, a peasant in Spain,

4677
02:53:36,239 --> 02:53:39,029
if the emperor is crazy Nero

4678
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:41,159
or good Vespasian?

4679
02:53:41,159 --> 02:53:43,498
I mean, how does that affect your day-to-day life?

4680
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:46,830
How does it affect you if you're a peasant in Italy,

4681
02:53:46,829 --> 02:53:48,809
which is the average inhabitant?

4682
02:53:48,809 --> 02:53:51,418
I mean, the crazy emperors

4683
02:53:51,420 --> 02:53:53,489
mostly affect the people

4684
02:53:53,489 --> 02:53:55,498
within the sound of their voice.

4685
02:53:55,500 --> 02:53:56,760
So yeah, they go crazy.

4686
02:53:56,760 --> 02:53:57,989
They murder senators,

4687
02:53:57,989 --> 02:53:59,128
they murdered their members,

4688
02:53:59,129 --> 02:54:00,059
their own family.

4689
02:54:00,059 --> 02:54:01,889
They do wacky stuff.

4690
02:54:01,889 --> 02:54:03,449
But a lot of that is constrained

4691
02:54:03,450 --> 02:54:05,940
to the immediate surroundings around them.

4692
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:06,810
And meanwhile,

4693
02:54:06,809 --> 02:54:10,289
the mechanism of the Roman Empire

4694
02:54:10,290 --> 02:54:13,410
is just grinding along as it would anyway.

4695
02:54:13,409 --> 02:54:15,449
I mean, the governors are running their provinces,

4696
02:54:15,450 --> 02:54:16,867
stuff's happening, you know.

4697
02:54:16,867 --> 02:54:19,710
I mean, I guess an emperor can start a war,

4698
02:54:19,709 --> 02:54:22,168
he can maybe raise taxes,

4699
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:23,040
but that would be the ways

4700
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:24,780
that he's affecting the whole empire.

4701
02:54:24,780 --> 02:54:27,570
And here we get into technology does matter.

4702
02:54:27,569 --> 02:54:29,578
We are dealing with a world where, let's say,

4703
02:54:29,579 --> 02:54:30,778
you're in Roman near the emperor,

4704
02:54:30,780 --> 02:54:34,949
and you wanna send a message to a province far away.

4705
02:54:34,950 --> 02:54:36,543
Let's say, Judea.

4706
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:40,740
That message might take one or two months to get there

4707
02:54:40,739 --> 02:54:43,109
and one or two months to get a reply.

4708
02:54:43,110 --> 02:54:45,480
So how much influence as emperor

4709
02:54:45,479 --> 02:54:48,778
are you really having over that province?

4710
02:54:48,780 --> 02:54:49,830
I mean, those people pretty much

4711
02:54:49,829 --> 02:54:51,539
have to make their own decisions

4712
02:54:51,540 --> 02:54:52,618
and then kind of just say to you,

4713
02:54:52,619 --> 02:54:53,520
"This is what we did.

4714
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:54,749
I hope that's okay."

4715
02:54:54,750 --> 02:54:56,100
Because, otherwise, nothing gets done

4716
02:54:56,100 --> 02:54:58,680
if they're waiting four months for a decision.

4717
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:00,150
- Even in their realm of ideas,

4718
02:55:00,149 --> 02:55:02,968
they can't get on TV

4719
02:55:02,969 --> 02:55:05,308
and on the radio- - Yeah.

4720
02:55:05,309 --> 02:55:07,438
- and broadcast. - Communication is so slow

4721
02:55:07,439 --> 02:55:10,080
and so uncertain in ways that,

4722
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:12,538
today, with the ability to instantaneously talk

4723
02:55:12,540 --> 02:55:14,879
to people across the world, we can't even imagine.

4724
02:55:14,879 --> 02:55:16,108
And the Roman Empire is huge.

4725
02:55:16,110 --> 02:55:18,840
I mean, it is months to send a message

4726
02:55:18,840 --> 02:55:20,460
and get an answer.

4727
02:55:20,459 --> 02:55:22,829
So here you have the emperor in Rome.

4728
02:55:22,829 --> 02:55:24,268
Yeah, he affects who's around him.

4729
02:55:24,270 --> 02:55:25,860
And he can affect even common people.

4730
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:26,999
I mean, there's crazy emperors

4731
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,100
who are at the games, and they're bored,

4732
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:30,840
and they say, "Well, take that whole section of the crowd

4733
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:33,029
and throw 'em to the lions or something."

4734
02:55:33,030 --> 02:55:34,980
There, you're being affected by the emperor.

4735
02:55:34,979 --> 02:55:38,608
But if you're outside the range of his sight and voice,

4736
02:55:38,610 --> 02:55:40,949
do you care who the emperor is?

4737
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:42,359
- So the big one- - Most of the time.

4738
02:55:42,360 --> 02:55:43,380
- that's a really important idea

4739
02:55:43,379 --> 02:55:45,988
as a sort of to remember.

4740
02:55:45,989 --> 02:55:47,732
Same with US president, frankly.

4741
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:52,560
In terms of the grand arc of history,

4742
02:55:52,559 --> 02:55:54,109
like what is the actual impact?

4743
02:55:54,959 --> 02:55:57,899
But I would say the big one is probably starting wars.

4744
02:55:57,899 --> 02:56:00,539
- Yeah. Yep. - Major global wars.

4745
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:03,299
Or ending them. In both directions.

4746
02:56:03,299 --> 02:56:05,908
And then taxation too, as you said.

4747
02:56:05,909 --> 02:56:07,108
What was the taxation?

4748
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:08,190
What was the economic system?

4749
02:56:08,190 --> 02:56:10,469
What was the role of taxation in Roman Empire?

4750
02:56:10,469 --> 02:56:12,045
- Romans are really weird with this.

4751
02:56:12,046 --> 02:56:14,250
So in the Republic,

4752
02:56:14,250 --> 02:56:18,780
once they started to acquire overseas provinces, right,

4753
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:19,620
they had to decide, well,

4754
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:21,689
what are we gonna do with these provinces?

4755
02:56:21,690 --> 02:56:23,1000
And they, in the end, settled on this notion of

4756
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:25,830
we'll put a Roman governor in charge,

4757
02:56:25,829 --> 02:56:27,958
we'll collect some sort of taxes.

4758
02:56:27,959 --> 02:56:31,168
But they often didn't collect the taxes directly.

4759
02:56:31,170 --> 02:56:33,509
Instead, they would sell contracts

4760
02:56:33,510 --> 02:56:36,750
to private businesses to collect taxes.

4761
02:56:36,750 --> 02:56:38,707
So the private businesses would bid and say,

4762
02:56:38,707 --> 02:56:40,469
"All right, if you give us the contract

4763
02:56:40,469 --> 02:56:42,329
to collect taxes in Sicily,

4764
02:56:42,329 --> 02:56:44,518
we'll give you X number of money up front,

4765
02:56:44,520 --> 02:56:45,570
and then we go out

4766
02:56:45,569 --> 02:56:49,198
and try to collect enough to make back that money

4767
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:50,940
and make ourselves a profit."

4768
02:56:50,940 --> 02:56:52,770
And this is a terrible system

4769
02:56:52,770 --> 02:56:54,240
because, obviously, they're gonna go and try

4770
02:56:54,239 --> 02:56:57,538
and squeeze as much as they can out of Sicily.

4771
02:56:57,540 --> 02:57:01,189
And these companies were called publicans, publicani.

4772
02:57:02,077 --> 02:57:03,478
And in the Bible, there's a phrase,

4773
02:57:03,479 --> 02:57:05,158
publicans and sinners,

4774
02:57:05,159 --> 02:57:08,399
and that should give you an idea how they're viewed.

4775
02:57:08,399 --> 02:57:10,649
So everybody hated these tax collectors,

4776
02:57:10,649 --> 02:57:13,079
and it was a really kind of dumb system

4777
02:57:13,079 --> 02:57:16,288
because, you know, the publicans are going out

4778
02:57:16,290 --> 02:57:18,330
and squeezing way more than they should

4779
02:57:18,329 --> 02:57:20,998
in an unhealthy way from the provinces.

4780
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,702
And the Roman state was doing this kind of weird thing

4781
02:57:23,702 --> 02:57:25,738
that they should have been doing themselves.

4782
02:57:25,739 --> 02:57:27,299
And over time, that shifts a bit

4783
02:57:27,299 --> 02:57:29,186
and it becomes more like your standard taxation.

4784
02:57:29,186 --> 02:57:32,819
And a lot of the taxation ends up being in kind too.

4785
02:57:32,819 --> 02:57:34,468
So it's like, okay, we're taxing you.

4786
02:57:34,469 --> 02:57:36,808
You pay it in wheat if you're a farmer or something.

4787
02:57:36,809 --> 02:57:38,759
Not necessarily in cash.

4788
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:40,679
So it was in, in many ways,

4789
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:44,970
the Roman economy is under underdeveloped.

4790
02:57:44,969 --> 02:57:47,578
They didn't have a lot of the sophisticated systems

4791
02:57:47,579 --> 02:57:48,539
that we have today,

4792
02:57:48,540 --> 02:57:51,780
and it probably held them back in some ways.

4793
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:54,960
And, again, they have that resistance to change.

4794
02:57:54,959 --> 02:57:57,249
The Romans also had weird notions about

4795
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:00,930
just business and profit making.

4796
02:58:00,930 --> 02:58:03,809
At least, originally, there was this notion that's shameful.

4797
02:58:03,809 --> 02:58:05,909
Again, the only thing that's a worthwhile profession

4798
02:58:05,909 --> 02:58:06,902
is farming.

4799
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:11,370
So, you know, rich Romans would get involved

4800
02:58:11,370 --> 02:58:12,930
in what we would call business.

4801
02:58:12,930 --> 02:58:14,069
You know, manufacturing,

4802
02:58:14,069 --> 02:58:16,499
particularly long distance trade with ships.

4803
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:17,430
But they would often do it

4804
02:58:17,430 --> 02:58:19,979
through sort of front companies or employees

4805
02:58:19,979 --> 02:58:22,168
who did it on their behalf, officially,

4806
02:58:22,170 --> 02:58:23,730
and then they sort of funnel the profits

4807
02:58:23,729 --> 02:58:24,749
to the guy funding it

4808
02:58:24,750 --> 02:58:26,1000
because they don't want to be soiled

4809
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,580
with, you know, business which is beneath them.

4810
02:58:29,579 --> 02:58:31,409
So the Romans had a lot of weird attitudes

4811
02:58:31,409 --> 02:58:32,529
about the economy

4812
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:36,419
that I think, in some ways, didn't help.

4813
02:58:36,420 --> 02:58:38,030
- But nevertheless, then many of the elements

4814
02:58:38,030 --> 02:58:40,230
of the modern economic system,

4815
02:58:40,229 --> 02:58:43,588
with taxation, the record keeping...

4816
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:44,670
- They were good at record keeping.

4817
02:58:44,670 --> 02:58:45,503
So the Romans,

4818
02:58:45,503 --> 02:58:47,519
I mean, the census is a Roman word.

4819
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:49,377
They're the ones that came up with that, so.

4820
02:58:49,377 --> 02:58:51,360
- And obviously, the laws around everything.

4821
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:52,920
- Yes. So in certain ways, yes,

4822
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:54,420
they were extremely sophisticated.

4823
02:58:54,420 --> 02:58:55,290
And of course the, you know,

4824
02:58:55,290 --> 02:58:57,209
the biggest thing about people

4825
02:58:57,209 --> 02:58:58,229
in the ancient world and today

4826
02:58:58,229 --> 02:59:00,152
is that they weren't stupider than us.

4827
02:59:00,153 --> 02:59:01,980
I mean, sometimes you get this assumption,

4828
02:59:01,979 --> 02:59:03,539
oh, well, in the ancient world,

4829
02:59:03,540 --> 02:59:04,919
they just weren't as smart or something.

4830
02:59:04,920 --> 02:59:07,410
No, no, no. They were fully as intelligent as we were.

4831
02:59:07,409 --> 02:59:10,799
They didn't have access to the same technology as we do,

4832
02:59:10,799 --> 02:59:13,149
but that doesn't mean they were any less smart.

4833
02:59:14,040 --> 02:59:16,589
- Can we talk about the crisis of the 3rd century

4834
02:59:16,590 --> 02:59:21,590
and the aforementioned Western and Eastern Roman empires?

4835
02:59:22,020 --> 02:59:23,699
How it split?

4836
02:59:23,700 --> 02:59:25,320
- Yeah. So, I mean,

4837
02:59:25,319 --> 02:59:27,868
after Rome starts to go downhill

4838
02:59:27,870 --> 02:59:30,120
as you enter the 3rd century,

4839
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:31,080
so the 200s,

4840
02:59:31,079 --> 02:59:33,212
so we're moving out of the golden era now,

4841
02:59:34,358 --> 02:59:35,940
I mean, a famous Roman historian,

4842
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:38,880
Cassius Dio, who lived right at that moment,

4843
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:40,133
very famously wrote

4844
02:59:40,134 --> 02:59:43,447
of the transition of Marcus Aurelius to what follows,

4845
02:59:43,447 --> 02:59:46,559
"Our kingdom now descends from one of gold

4846
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:48,628
to one of rust and iron."

4847
02:59:48,629 --> 02:59:51,689
So even people who are alive at the time

4848
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:52,889
had a distinct sense

4849
02:59:52,889 --> 02:59:55,288
something is going downhill here.

4850
02:59:55,290 --> 02:59:56,669
And that's interesting,

4851
02:59:56,670 --> 02:59:57,899
because, you know, usually,

4852
02:59:57,899 --> 03:00:00,718
great historical moments are retroactive.

4853
03:00:00,719 --> 03:00:01,805
And I mean, here's a guy who said,

4854
03:00:01,807 --> 03:00:03,599
"Oh, something is going wrong.

4855
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:05,487
Something is really going badly now."

4856
03:00:06,389 --> 03:00:10,349
And a lot of it becomes that the secret is out.

4857
03:00:10,350 --> 03:00:12,029
That what makes an emperor

4858
03:00:12,030 --> 03:00:14,039
is who commands the most swords.

4859
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:16,709
And so you start to get rebellions

4860
03:00:16,709 --> 03:00:18,358
by various Roman generals,

4861
03:00:18,360 --> 03:00:20,580
each declaring himself emperor.

4862
03:00:20,579 --> 03:00:22,319
So you'd always had this to a certain degree,

4863
03:00:22,319 --> 03:00:25,408
but they had kept it in check during the 2nd century AD.

4864
03:00:25,409 --> 03:00:26,638
But in the 3rd century,

4865
03:00:26,639 --> 03:00:28,918
you sometimes get three or four generals

4866
03:00:28,920 --> 03:00:30,149
in different parts of the empire

4867
03:00:30,149 --> 03:00:32,038
all declaring themselves emperor,

4868
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:34,080
and then they all rush off to Rome

4869
03:00:34,079 --> 03:00:36,659
to fight a multi-way civil war.

4870
03:00:36,659 --> 03:00:38,129
And of course, while they're doing this,

4871
03:00:38,129 --> 03:00:39,508
the borders are undefended,

4872
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:41,699
so barbarians start to see opportunity

4873
03:00:41,700 --> 03:00:43,769
and come across and start raiding.

4874
03:00:43,770 --> 03:00:46,109
They start burning and pillaging farms,

4875
03:00:46,110 --> 03:00:49,679
the civil wars are destroying cities and farms,

4876
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:51,902
so the economy is kind of tanking,

4877
03:00:52,770 --> 03:00:55,379
then there's less money coming in as taxes.

4878
03:00:55,379 --> 03:00:56,939
So when one guy finally wins,

4879
03:00:56,940 --> 03:00:59,549
he jacks up the tax rate to try and make up for it,

4880
03:00:59,549 --> 03:01:01,948
but now there's fewer people able to pay,

4881
03:01:01,950 --> 03:01:03,693
and it's all just a vicious cycle.

4882
03:01:04,530 --> 03:01:06,929
The Romans start to debase the coinage,

4883
03:01:06,930 --> 03:01:07,763
which means, you know,

4884
03:01:07,763 --> 03:01:09,450
you take in a gold coin,

4885
03:01:09,450 --> 03:01:10,950
you melt it down,

4886
03:01:10,950 --> 03:01:13,590
mix it in with 10% something less valuable,

4887
03:01:13,590 --> 03:01:15,929
and then stamp it and say it's worth the same.

4888
03:01:15,930 --> 03:01:17,099
Well, people aren't stupid.

4889
03:01:17,100 --> 03:01:19,740
They're gonna know that's only 90% of that gold coin.

4890
03:01:19,739 --> 03:01:21,808
- They've invented inflation. - Inflation.

4891
03:01:21,809 --> 03:01:24,568
And you get horrific inflation uncontrolled.

4892
03:01:24,569 --> 03:01:26,729
So, you know, the economy goes downhill,

4893
03:01:26,729 --> 03:01:27,958
barbarians are raiding,

4894
03:01:27,959 --> 03:01:29,878
you have internal instability,

4895
03:01:29,879 --> 03:01:31,739
in one year, you have something like

4896
03:01:31,739 --> 03:01:33,029
eight or nine different guys

4897
03:01:33,030 --> 03:01:35,309
go through as emperor in 238.

4898
03:01:35,309 --> 03:01:36,508
So it's a mess.

4899
03:01:36,510 --> 03:01:38,550
And it looks like the Roman Empire

4900
03:01:38,549 --> 03:01:41,339
is gonna fall in around the mid 3rd century.

4901
03:01:41,340 --> 03:01:43,200
So this is the crisis.

4902
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:45,869
And then the kind of shocking development is,

4903
03:01:45,870 --> 03:01:47,789
late in that 3rd century,

4904
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:50,549
they actually stabilize the empire.

4905
03:01:50,549 --> 03:01:54,058
So you have a series of these kind of army emperors,

4906
03:01:54,059 --> 03:01:55,409
who are just good generals,

4907
03:01:55,409 --> 03:01:58,679
who managed to push the barbarians out,

4908
03:01:58,680 --> 03:02:00,573
reestablish the borders.

4909
03:02:01,469 --> 03:02:02,848
It's actually a whole group of them,

4910
03:02:02,850 --> 03:02:04,140
but often they get clumped

4911
03:02:04,139 --> 03:02:05,879
under the most successful, the last guy,

4912
03:02:05,879 --> 03:02:09,119
who is Diocletian, who comes in,

4913
03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:12,209
and he tries to stabilize the economy.

4914
03:02:12,209 --> 03:02:13,469
One of the things he does

4915
03:02:13,469 --> 03:02:16,618
is he issues a new solid gold coin

4916
03:02:16,620 --> 03:02:18,210
that he guarantee is a solid gold,

4917
03:02:18,209 --> 03:02:19,769
and he calls it a solidus,

4918
03:02:19,770 --> 03:02:21,689
a solid coin.

4919
03:02:21,690 --> 03:02:24,330
He famously issues a price edict

4920
03:02:24,329 --> 03:02:27,599
where he says, "This is the maximum it's legal to charge

4921
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:29,640
for any good or service."

4922
03:02:29,639 --> 03:02:31,499
So it's attempt to curb inflation.

4923
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:33,873
And that's not gonna work, but it helps.

4924
03:02:34,829 --> 03:02:37,139
Kind of amusingly, on Diocletian's price edict,

4925
03:02:37,139 --> 03:02:40,292
can you guess what the most expensive sort of item is?

4926
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:42,692
Hiring a lawyer.

4927
03:02:44,069 --> 03:02:46,019
So some things never change, right?

4928
03:02:46,020 --> 03:02:47,058
- Oh, that's interesting.

4929
03:02:47,058 --> 03:02:49,558
I mean, in that system,

4930
03:02:49,559 --> 03:02:51,628
there's probably a huge amount of lawyers.

4931
03:02:51,629 --> 03:02:53,489
- Yeah, I mean even lawyers isn't quite the right word.

4932
03:02:53,489 --> 03:02:54,898
Romans didn't have true lawyers,

4933
03:02:54,899 --> 03:02:57,778
but they had people you would hire to do legal stuff

4934
03:02:57,780 --> 03:02:59,760
or give you legal advice, but anyway.

4935
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:01,829
No, the price edict is actually is really fascinating,

4936
03:03:01,829 --> 03:03:03,449
'cause it's this long list of stuff

4937
03:03:03,450 --> 03:03:04,290
and you can see, you know,

4938
03:03:04,290 --> 03:03:06,510
a good pair of shoes, a bad pair of shoes,

4939
03:03:06,510 --> 03:03:07,800
how much each cost,

4940
03:03:07,799 --> 03:03:10,739
and you can see the relative value of things.

4941
03:03:10,739 --> 03:03:13,049
So, you know, what was food versus clothing,

4942
03:03:13,049 --> 03:03:13,889
what was, you know,

4943
03:03:13,889 --> 03:03:16,469
going to the barber versus hiring a doctor,

4944
03:03:16,469 --> 03:03:17,638
all that kind of stuff.

4945
03:03:17,639 --> 03:03:20,389
So it's a really fun document to just mess around with.

4946
03:03:21,420 --> 03:03:23,969
But anyway, so Diocletian stabilizes,

4947
03:03:23,969 --> 03:03:25,138
basically, the empire

4948
03:03:25,139 --> 03:03:26,548
and these other guys as well,

4949
03:03:26,549 --> 03:03:28,351
and gives it a new lease on life.

4950
03:03:29,190 --> 03:03:31,680
So it seems, by the end of the 3rd century,

4951
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:33,720
that Rome is gonna continue.

4952
03:03:33,719 --> 03:03:35,998
And then as we go into the 4th century,

4953
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:37,500
you have the really dramatic thing

4954
03:03:37,500 --> 03:03:39,870
where Constantine comes along

4955
03:03:39,870 --> 03:03:42,240
and converts to Christianity.

4956
03:03:42,239 --> 03:03:44,518
And at the time he converts, you know,

4957
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:48,029
the percentage of Christians in the Empire is small.

4958
03:03:48,030 --> 03:03:49,350
You know, 10% at most.

4959
03:03:49,350 --> 03:03:50,700
Something like that. Who knows?

4960
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:52,200
But it's quite small.

4961
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:53,470
And all of a sudden, you have this weird thing

4962
03:03:53,469 --> 03:03:56,609
where now the emperor belongs to this new religion,

4963
03:03:56,610 --> 03:03:57,783
what does this mean?

4964
03:03:58,649 --> 03:04:00,838
You can debate a lot how sincere

4965
03:04:00,840 --> 03:04:03,509
Constantine's conversion was.

4966
03:04:03,510 --> 03:04:05,490
It's a little bit of a weird thing

4967
03:04:05,489 --> 03:04:07,649
where he clearly is using it as a way

4968
03:04:07,649 --> 03:04:10,619
to fire up the troops before a crucial battle

4969
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:12,269
to say, "Hey, I just had this dream

4970
03:04:12,270 --> 03:04:13,679
and this God promised us victory

4971
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:15,840
if we put his magic symbol on our shields."

4972
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:17,400
And this would be okay,

4973
03:04:17,399 --> 03:04:19,858
except that he had done this a couple times before.

4974
03:04:19,860 --> 03:04:22,080
So one time, it was Helios, the sun god.

4975
03:04:22,079 --> 03:04:23,939
One time, it was another god.

4976
03:04:23,940 --> 03:04:25,230
Even after he converts,

4977
03:04:25,229 --> 03:04:27,508
he continues to mint coins and stuff

4978
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:29,010
with other gods on them.

4979
03:04:29,010 --> 03:04:31,380
He continues to worship other gods.

4980
03:04:31,379 --> 03:04:34,198
But he also kind of seems sincere in his conversion.

4981
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:35,760
It's just, I think the question is

4982
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:38,760
how much does he understand his new religion

4983
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:41,550
maybe more than is it sincere?

4984
03:04:41,549 --> 03:04:43,049
But that's a real turning point.

4985
03:04:43,049 --> 03:04:45,269
So now as we go into the 4th century,

4986
03:04:45,270 --> 03:04:47,387
we have this thing with Constantine and the new religion,

4987
03:04:47,387 --> 03:04:49,290
and the other thing that happens is

4988
03:04:49,290 --> 03:04:52,140
the empire is really just too big

4989
03:04:52,139 --> 03:04:53,159
to govern effectively.

4990
03:04:53,159 --> 03:04:54,119
It's a thing we're talking about.

4991
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:55,529
It's too large,

4992
03:04:55,530 --> 03:04:57,419
the communication is too slow,

4993
03:04:57,420 --> 03:05:00,449
and it starts to naturally fragment.

4994
03:05:00,450 --> 03:05:02,789
And at times, they try systems

4995
03:05:02,790 --> 03:05:04,740
where they split it into four.

4996
03:05:04,739 --> 03:05:07,348
So under Diocletan, he tries the Tetrarchy,

4997
03:05:07,350 --> 03:05:08,880
where he splits the empire into four

4998
03:05:08,879 --> 03:05:10,499
and you actually have sort of four emperors

4999
03:05:10,500 --> 03:05:13,020
working together as a team.

5000
03:05:13,020 --> 03:05:15,629
More commonly, it just splits east to west.

5001
03:05:15,629 --> 03:05:17,038
So from that point on,

5002
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:19,950
you really start to have the history of the Western Empire

5003
03:05:19,950 --> 03:05:21,359
going in one direction,

5004
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:22,710
the Eastern Empire in the other,

5005
03:05:22,709 --> 03:05:25,168
you tend to have two emperors,

5006
03:05:25,170 --> 03:05:28,469
though there are moments, occasionally, where they reunite.

5007
03:05:28,469 --> 03:05:30,329
So that's a big development as well,

5008
03:05:30,329 --> 03:05:32,759
and that's a turning point.

5009
03:05:32,760 --> 03:05:36,090
- So the most common date that people say,

5010
03:05:36,090 --> 03:05:37,259
maybe you can correct me on this,

5011
03:05:37,260 --> 03:05:41,099
that the Roman Empire fell is 476 AD.

5012
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:43,447
They're referring to the fall, quote, unquote,

5013
03:05:43,447 --> 03:05:45,450
"of the Western Roman Empire."

5014
03:05:45,450 --> 03:05:49,110
So why did the Roman Empire fall?

5015
03:05:49,110 --> 03:05:50,339
- Yeah, this is a real game.

5016
03:05:50,340 --> 03:05:53,429
Pick your favorite date for the fall of the Roman Empire.

5017
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:55,260
476 is a very common one.

5018
03:05:55,260 --> 03:05:56,669
And what happens in that year

5019
03:05:56,670 --> 03:05:59,670
is a barbarian king comes down into Italy

5020
03:05:59,670 --> 03:06:04,439
and deposes a guy named Romulus Augustulus,

5021
03:06:04,440 --> 03:06:06,444
which is an amazing name.

5022
03:06:06,444 --> 03:06:09,988
It's combining the names of the founder of Rome, Romulus,

5023
03:06:09,989 --> 03:06:12,722
with Augustus, the second founder of Rome.

5024
03:06:13,950 --> 03:06:17,430
And so some people say that's the end of the Roman Empire.

5025
03:06:17,430 --> 03:06:20,430
Sure. But others say it's 410

5026
03:06:20,430 --> 03:06:23,970
when Alaric sacks Rome for the first time.

5027
03:06:23,969 --> 03:06:25,739
Others say it's 455

5028
03:06:25,739 --> 03:06:27,868
when the Vandals come and sack Rome

5029
03:06:27,870 --> 03:06:30,810
and do a much more thorough job of it this time.

5030
03:06:30,809 --> 03:06:33,358
Some say it's 180 when Marcus Aurelius

5031
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:34,920
picks poorly in succession.

5032
03:06:34,920 --> 03:06:38,489
Some say it's 31 when Octavian wins the Battle of Actium

5033
03:06:38,489 --> 03:06:40,112
and kills the Roman Republic.

5034
03:06:41,010 --> 03:06:42,540
Or you can go past that date

5035
03:06:42,540 --> 03:06:44,549
and say it's 1453

5036
03:06:44,549 --> 03:06:47,698
when the Eastern Roman Empire finally falls.

5037
03:06:47,700 --> 03:06:48,960
And I mean the Eastern Empire

5038
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:50,429
is legitimately the Roman Empire.

5039
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:52,530
If you were go and ask them, "Who are you?"

5040
03:06:52,530 --> 03:06:53,437
They wouldn't say, you know,

5041
03:06:53,436 --> 03:06:55,499
"We're the Byzantines, we're the Eastern Empire."

5042
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:57,990
They would just say, "We're the Romans."

5043
03:06:57,989 --> 03:07:01,529
And they have a completely legitimate claim to do that.

5044
03:07:01,530 --> 03:07:04,320
So this whole game of when does the empire fall

5045
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:06,299
is problematic.

5046
03:07:06,299 --> 03:07:07,349
And the other thing is

5047
03:07:07,350 --> 03:07:09,210
all those dates about invasions

5048
03:07:09,209 --> 03:07:11,548
that cluster around the 400s,

5049
03:07:11,549 --> 03:07:14,459
so 410, 455, 476,

5050
03:07:14,459 --> 03:07:15,749
you have to ask yourself:

5051
03:07:15,750 --> 03:07:18,959
who counts as a real Roman by that point?

5052
03:07:18,959 --> 03:07:21,809
Because for a while now,

5053
03:07:21,809 --> 03:07:23,698
the Romans themselves

5054
03:07:23,700 --> 03:07:27,300
are often coming from barbarians,

5055
03:07:27,299 --> 03:07:29,218
you know, or crossing that boundary.

5056
03:07:29,219 --> 03:07:31,649
Roman generals, they might get raised as a Hun

5057
03:07:31,649 --> 03:07:34,532
and serve with the Roman army for a while, then not,

5058
03:07:34,532 --> 03:07:36,539
or a Visigoths or not.

5059
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:38,403
That's been going on for a long time.

5060
03:07:39,272 --> 03:07:41,639
So what makes someone a real Roman?

5061
03:07:41,639 --> 03:07:44,159
How do you tell that the guy kicked out in 476

5062
03:07:44,159 --> 03:07:46,409
was a, quote, "real Roman,"

5063
03:07:46,409 --> 03:07:49,171
and the barbarian king who took his place wasn't?

5064
03:07:50,430 --> 03:07:52,740
That's a very arbitrary decision.

5065
03:07:52,739 --> 03:07:54,269
- There's so many interesting things there.

5066
03:07:54,270 --> 03:07:56,850
So of course you described really eloquently

5067
03:07:56,850 --> 03:08:01,080
the decline that started after Marcus Aurelius,

5068
03:08:01,079 --> 03:08:03,389
and there's a lot of competing ideas there

5069
03:08:03,389 --> 03:08:04,649
and the tension itself. - And just to interrupt you,

5070
03:08:04,649 --> 03:08:06,028
I hate wishy-washy answers,

5071
03:08:06,030 --> 03:08:06,930
which is why I kind of said,

5072
03:08:06,930 --> 03:08:08,609
so I will give you this. - Yes.

5073
03:08:08,610 --> 03:08:11,100
- I think by the end of the 5th century AD,

5074
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:14,399
the Western Roman Empire has transformed

5075
03:08:14,399 --> 03:08:16,048
into something different. - Yeah.

5076
03:08:16,049 --> 03:08:18,868
- So I don't know what date I can pick for that,

5077
03:08:18,870 --> 03:08:20,910
but I can say, by the end,

5078
03:08:20,909 --> 03:08:22,169
by around 500,

5079
03:08:22,170 --> 03:08:24,960
I don't know that we can call whatever exists there

5080
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:26,939
the Roman Empire anymore.

5081
03:08:26,940 --> 03:08:29,190
- And of course the barbarians make everything complicated

5082
03:08:29,190 --> 03:08:31,620
because they seem to be willing to fight on every side

5083
03:08:31,620 --> 03:08:34,019
and they're like fluid,

5084
03:08:34,020 --> 03:08:35,880
- Yes. - which, they integrate fast,

5085
03:08:35,879 --> 03:08:37,599
and it just makes the whole thing

5086
03:08:39,090 --> 03:08:40,469
really tricky to say,

5087
03:08:40,469 --> 03:08:42,025
yeah, who's a Roman, who's not,

5088
03:08:42,027 --> 03:08:43,680
and at which point did it, like-

5089
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:45,809
- And barbarians have been forming large parts

5090
03:08:45,809 --> 03:08:48,599
of the Roman Army for centuries, you know?

5091
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:50,999
Yeah, it's extremely fluid

5092
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,160
and not at all just clear sides here,

5093
03:08:53,159 --> 03:08:54,388
so it's a mess.

5094
03:08:54,389 --> 03:08:57,119
- From a military perspective, perhaps,

5095
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:59,220
what are some things that stand out to you

5096
03:08:59,219 --> 03:09:02,098
on the pressure from the barbarians?

5097
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:07,100
The conflicts, whether it's the Huns or the Visigoths?

5098
03:09:07,469 --> 03:09:09,388
- There was a military strategist,

5099
03:09:09,389 --> 03:09:11,976
a guy named Edward Luttwak, who wrote this book,

5100
03:09:11,977 --> 03:09:14,460
"The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire,"

5101
03:09:14,459 --> 03:09:16,918
which was basically about frontiers

5102
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:19,739
and how did the Romans define their frontier.

5103
03:09:19,739 --> 03:09:21,356
And everybody's jumped on this and argue about,

5104
03:09:21,356 --> 03:09:22,529
and says it's wrong and all,

5105
03:09:22,530 --> 03:09:24,960
but started this debate among Roman historians

5106
03:09:24,959 --> 03:09:28,439
about, yeah, what does frontier mean to the Romans?

5107
03:09:28,440 --> 03:09:31,230
Did they conceive of their empires having a border

5108
03:09:31,229 --> 03:09:33,596
or was it always expanding or what,

5109
03:09:33,596 --> 03:09:35,608
and did they have a grand strategy?

5110
03:09:35,610 --> 03:09:38,670
I mean, today, militaries have a strategy

5111
03:09:38,670 --> 03:09:40,260
where we want to achieve this,

5112
03:09:40,260 --> 03:09:42,240
we want to, you know, exert force here,

5113
03:09:42,239 --> 03:09:44,099
we want to protect these areas.

5114
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:47,280
Did the Romans even visualize their empire

5115
03:09:47,280 --> 03:09:49,679
in that sort of grand strategic way?

5116
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:51,119
And it's a real debate.

5117
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:52,769
I mean, there's some things that suggest,

5118
03:09:52,770 --> 03:09:55,169
oh, here, they tried to rationalize the border

5119
03:09:55,170 --> 03:09:56,730
and short it by taking,

5120
03:09:56,729 --> 03:09:58,648
or shorten it by taking this territory.

5121
03:09:58,649 --> 03:10:01,139
Other people see as just kind of random.

5122
03:10:01,139 --> 03:10:04,259
So that's an interesting take is

5123
03:10:04,260 --> 03:10:06,510
how did the Romans conceive of empire?

5124
03:10:06,510 --> 03:10:08,820
I mean, if you look back at someone like Virgil

5125
03:10:08,819 --> 03:10:10,176
at the time of Augustus, he said,

5126
03:10:10,176 --> 03:10:14,188
"Well, the Gods granted Rome empire without end."

5127
03:10:14,190 --> 03:10:16,350
So it's that open-ended thing.

5128
03:10:16,350 --> 03:10:17,610
But even under Augustus,

5129
03:10:17,610 --> 03:10:19,049
he seems to be pulling back

5130
03:10:19,049 --> 03:10:21,149
and saying, "Well, I'm gonna kind of stop at the Rhine.

5131
03:10:21,149 --> 03:10:23,309
I'm gonna kind of stop at the Danube.

5132
03:10:23,309 --> 03:10:25,198
We don't need to keep expanding forever

5133
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:27,300
in the way we've been doing."

5134
03:10:27,299 --> 03:10:30,839
So I mean, that's an interesting concept

5135
03:10:30,840 --> 03:10:33,179
of how do the Romans see their empire?

5136
03:10:33,180 --> 03:10:34,409
Does it have a boundary?

5137
03:10:34,409 --> 03:10:35,699
What are those boundaries?

5138
03:10:35,700 --> 03:10:36,720
What does that mean?

5139
03:10:36,719 --> 03:10:41,638
- And then barbarians were very much making that boundary

5140
03:10:41,639 --> 03:10:43,379
even more difficult to kind of define it

5141
03:10:43,379 --> 03:10:44,633
even if you wanted to.

5142
03:10:44,634 --> 03:10:46,770
- Right. And again, the other fun debate is

5143
03:10:46,770 --> 03:10:49,049
were these invasions, you know,

5144
03:10:49,049 --> 03:10:51,209
when the Visigoths cross the Danube

5145
03:10:51,209 --> 03:10:52,469
and come into the Roman Empire,

5146
03:10:52,469 --> 03:10:53,789
is this an invasion,

5147
03:10:53,790 --> 03:10:55,380
as it was originally described,

5148
03:10:55,379 --> 03:10:57,209
or is it a migration,

5149
03:10:57,209 --> 03:11:00,028
as some scholars have started calling it?

5150
03:11:00,030 --> 03:11:02,280
Because the Visigoths were fleeing pressure

5151
03:11:02,280 --> 03:11:03,570
from another Gothic group,

5152
03:11:03,569 --> 03:11:05,758
and they were fleeing pressure from the Huns.

5153
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:08,789
And I mean, a lot of the early Gothic peoples

5154
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:10,229
who come into the Roman Empire

5155
03:11:10,229 --> 03:11:12,418
are basically seeking asylum.

5156
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:14,910
They're saying, "Will you give us a piece of territory

5157
03:11:14,909 --> 03:11:17,849
to live on within the boundaries of the empire?

5158
03:11:17,850 --> 03:11:19,499
And in return we will fight for you

5159
03:11:19,500 --> 03:11:21,030
against external enemies."

5160
03:11:21,030 --> 03:11:23,789
And the Romans make these deals with some of the Goths.

5161
03:11:23,790 --> 03:11:26,673
In fact, they made a pretty good deal with the Goths,

5162
03:11:27,510 --> 03:11:29,340
one group of Goths to do exactly that.

5163
03:11:29,340 --> 03:11:31,259
Like, you can settle within the boundaries,

5164
03:11:31,260 --> 03:11:32,093
we'll feed you,

5165
03:11:32,093 --> 03:11:33,359
we'll give you a certain amount of stuff,

5166
03:11:33,360 --> 03:11:34,589
and you fight for us.

5167
03:11:34,590 --> 03:11:37,080
And then the Romans treated them really badly.

5168
03:11:37,079 --> 03:11:39,358
They kind of didn't supply what they had promised,

5169
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:41,310
and so they turned against the Romans

5170
03:11:41,309 --> 03:11:42,659
with good reason.

5171
03:11:42,659 --> 03:11:45,089
So the Romans blundered in these things too.

5172
03:11:45,090 --> 03:11:47,279
- So is it correct that the Visigoths

5173
03:11:47,280 --> 03:11:48,719
fought on the side of the Romans

5174
03:11:48,719 --> 03:11:50,759
against Attila the Hun?

5175
03:11:50,760 --> 03:11:51,750
- Some of them did. - Okay.

5176
03:11:51,750 --> 03:11:53,790
- So again, there were various groups

5177
03:11:53,790 --> 03:11:56,129
on both sides of those battles.

5178
03:11:56,129 --> 03:11:58,681
So Attila is the famous Hun.

5179
03:11:59,639 --> 03:12:02,219
And he comes into the Roman Empire

5180
03:12:02,219 --> 03:12:04,529
and seems to be heading right for Rome

5181
03:12:04,530 --> 03:12:06,302
to, you know, knock it off.

5182
03:12:07,201 --> 03:12:09,449
And everybody is so scared of the Huns

5183
03:12:09,450 --> 03:12:12,180
that this weird coalition comes together

5184
03:12:12,180 --> 03:12:15,120
of the Romans plus various barbarian groups

5185
03:12:15,120 --> 03:12:17,519
against Attila in league with some other barbarian groups,

5186
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:19,080
and they fight a huge battle,

5187
03:12:19,079 --> 03:12:20,879
and it's more or less a stalemate.

5188
03:12:20,879 --> 03:12:23,226
So Attila gets stopped, and he says,

5189
03:12:23,227 --> 03:12:25,050
"All right, we're gonna just rest up for a year.

5190
03:12:25,049 --> 03:12:27,508
Next year, we'll go finish off the Romans."

5191
03:12:27,510 --> 03:12:28,530
Next year comes,

5192
03:12:28,530 --> 03:12:30,030
he heads down into Italy,

5193
03:12:30,030 --> 03:12:31,650
he's heading straight for Rome,

5194
03:12:31,649 --> 03:12:34,619
and the Pope goes and meets Attila,

5195
03:12:34,620 --> 03:12:37,680
and they have lunch together at this river.

5196
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:39,059
And at the end of the lunch,

5197
03:12:39,059 --> 03:12:41,999
Attila goes back and says, "Eh, I changed my mind.

5198
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,470
We're gonna go back up to France,

5199
03:12:43,469 --> 03:12:44,459
hang around for another year,

5200
03:12:44,459 --> 03:12:46,499
we'll finish off the Romans later."

5201
03:12:46,500 --> 03:12:49,020
And, you know, Christian sources say,

5202
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:51,831
saints appeared in the sky with flaming swords

5203
03:12:51,832 --> 03:12:54,239
and, you know, scared away Attila.

5204
03:12:54,239 --> 03:12:55,468
Some other sources say,

5205
03:12:55,469 --> 03:12:57,509
well, the Pope gave Attila a huge bribe

5206
03:12:57,510 --> 03:12:59,189
to go away for a while.

5207
03:12:59,190 --> 03:13:01,529
Believe whichever you like.

5208
03:13:01,530 --> 03:13:04,559
But then Attila ends up dying on his wedding night

5209
03:13:04,559 --> 03:13:08,009
before he comes back under mysterious circumstances,

5210
03:13:08,010 --> 03:13:09,960
and so that never materializes

5211
03:13:09,959 --> 03:13:12,479
and the Huns kind of fragment after his death.

5212
03:13:12,479 --> 03:13:16,738
- So what was the definitive blow by the barbarians,

5213
03:13:16,739 --> 03:13:17,908
by the Visigoths?

5214
03:13:17,909 --> 03:13:20,699
- The barbarians are so many different groups,

5215
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:23,130
and weirdly, I think an important one

5216
03:13:23,129 --> 03:13:24,508
that sometimes people tend to focus

5217
03:13:24,510 --> 03:13:26,370
on the Huns and the Goths.

5218
03:13:26,370 --> 03:13:29,999
The Vandals end up going to Spain,

5219
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:31,260
conquering Spain,

5220
03:13:31,260 --> 03:13:33,506
and then crossing over into North Africa

5221
03:13:33,506 --> 03:13:36,239
and kind of conquering North Africa as well.

5222
03:13:36,239 --> 03:13:38,039
And Spain and North Africa

5223
03:13:38,040 --> 03:13:41,520
were some of the main areas

5224
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:44,250
that food surpluses were collected from

5225
03:13:44,250 --> 03:13:46,950
and sent to Rome to feed the city of Rome.

5226
03:13:46,950 --> 03:13:49,680
And it's after those Vandal invasions

5227
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:51,119
or the takeover of those areas

5228
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:53,789
that the population of Rome plummets.

5229
03:13:53,790 --> 03:13:55,770
So I think that's an interesting moment

5230
03:13:55,770 --> 03:13:57,209
where, you know, the city of Rome

5231
03:13:57,209 --> 03:13:58,769
had always been this symbol

5232
03:13:58,770 --> 03:14:01,319
and already it was no longer the capital.

5233
03:14:01,319 --> 03:14:03,269
The emperors had moved to Ravenna,

5234
03:14:03,270 --> 03:14:04,499
a little bit north,

5235
03:14:04,500 --> 03:14:06,360
because it was surrounded by swamps,

5236
03:14:06,360 --> 03:14:07,920
so it was more defensible.

5237
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:09,059
But there is something important

5238
03:14:09,059 --> 03:14:10,978
about that old symbolic capital

5239
03:14:10,979 --> 03:14:12,358
now just collapsing

5240
03:14:12,360 --> 03:14:14,670
in terms of population numbers

5241
03:14:14,670 --> 03:14:16,380
really no longer having importance

5242
03:14:16,379 --> 03:14:20,069
because, literally, its food supply is cut off

5243
03:14:20,069 --> 03:14:22,859
by losing those areas of the empire.

5244
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:24,303
And of course the capital,

5245
03:14:25,290 --> 03:14:28,589
Constantine had founded a new second capital

5246
03:14:28,590 --> 03:14:30,239
at what used to be Byzantium,

5247
03:14:30,239 --> 03:14:31,648
a Greek city on the Bosporus,

5248
03:14:31,649 --> 03:14:33,568
which becomes Constantinople.

5249
03:14:33,569 --> 03:14:36,569
He names it not very modestly after himself.

5250
03:14:36,569 --> 03:14:39,089
And that now is really the dominant city

5251
03:14:39,090 --> 03:14:41,040
for any of the Roman empires,

5252
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:42,150
Eastern or Western.

5253
03:14:42,149 --> 03:14:43,492
- So if you're actually living in that century,

5254
03:14:43,493 --> 03:14:45,240
the 5th century,

5255
03:14:45,239 --> 03:14:47,609
it's kind of like the Western Roman Empire dies

5256
03:14:47,610 --> 03:14:48,900
with a whimper.

5257
03:14:48,899 --> 03:14:50,462
It's not like,

5258
03:14:50,462 --> 03:14:52,379
it's a bunch of strikes. - Yeah.

5259
03:14:52,379 --> 03:14:53,249
- There's a lot of moments you can pick.

5260
03:14:53,250 --> 03:14:54,960
There's an earlier one in the 300s

5261
03:14:54,959 --> 03:14:56,009
when the Roman Empire,

5262
03:14:56,010 --> 03:14:58,230
the Romans lose a big battle

5263
03:14:58,229 --> 03:15:00,029
to, you know, some barbarians

5264
03:15:00,030 --> 03:15:01,740
that, symbolically, is important.

5265
03:15:01,739 --> 03:15:04,469
But yeah, I don't think there's one clear cut moment.

5266
03:15:04,469 --> 03:15:06,538
And again, I don't know that it is the barbarians

5267
03:15:06,540 --> 03:15:07,537
that cause, quote,

5268
03:15:07,537 --> 03:15:09,311
"the fall of the Roman Empire."

5269
03:15:09,310 --> 03:15:10,289
I mean, this is the other game,

5270
03:15:10,290 --> 03:15:11,190
as people like to say,

5271
03:15:11,190 --> 03:15:13,319
when did the Roman Empire fall?

5272
03:15:13,319 --> 03:15:15,988
The other big question is why,

5273
03:15:15,989 --> 03:15:18,629
you know, why did the Roman Empire fall?

5274
03:15:18,629 --> 03:15:20,849
If you define it as falling.

5275
03:15:20,850 --> 03:15:24,479
And I mean barbarian invasions was the traditional answer.

5276
03:15:24,479 --> 03:15:26,342
So there's a French historian famously said,

5277
03:15:26,343 --> 03:15:28,560
"The Roman Empire didn't fall,

5278
03:15:28,559 --> 03:15:29,549
it was murdered.

5279
03:15:29,549 --> 03:15:32,308
You know, it was killed by barbarians."

5280
03:15:32,309 --> 03:15:34,622
But I mean, there's other explanations.

5281
03:15:35,850 --> 03:15:37,380
You know, I mean, some people say

5282
03:15:37,379 --> 03:15:38,578
it was Christianity,

5283
03:15:38,579 --> 03:15:41,639
some say it was a climate.

5284
03:15:41,639 --> 03:15:46,379
That the Roman Empire flourished during this moment of luck

5285
03:15:46,379 --> 03:15:47,909
when just the climate was good,

5286
03:15:47,909 --> 03:15:50,759
and then you get this sort of late Roman little ice age,

5287
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:52,260
and everything goes downhill,

5288
03:15:52,260 --> 03:15:53,823
and that's what caused it.

5289
03:15:54,780 --> 03:15:56,640
There's some that say things like disease.

5290
03:15:56,639 --> 03:16:00,208
There were a whole series of waves of plague

5291
03:16:00,209 --> 03:16:02,548
that started to hit under Marcus Aurelius

5292
03:16:02,549 --> 03:16:04,169
and continued after him,

5293
03:16:04,170 --> 03:16:07,560
which seemed to caused real serious death

5294
03:16:07,559 --> 03:16:09,359
and economic disruption.

5295
03:16:09,360 --> 03:16:11,520
I mean, that's a decent explanation.

5296
03:16:11,520 --> 03:16:13,830
Another popular one is moral decline,

5297
03:16:13,829 --> 03:16:16,029
which I don't think really works well.

5298
03:16:16,030 --> 03:16:18,179
You even get the people saying, you know, lead poisoning,

5299
03:16:18,180 --> 03:16:19,680
but that's not true,

5300
03:16:19,680 --> 03:16:21,240
'cause they were drinking outta the same pipes

5301
03:16:21,239 --> 03:16:23,219
when the empire was expanding, right?

5302
03:16:23,219 --> 03:16:24,479
- Yeah, that's fascinating.

5303
03:16:24,479 --> 03:16:25,312
That's fascinating.

5304
03:16:25,313 --> 03:16:27,729
But often, we kind of agree

5305
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:31,529
that's something that you've talked about quite a bit

5306
03:16:31,530 --> 03:16:32,840
is the military perspective

5307
03:16:32,840 --> 03:16:34,509
is the one that defines

5308
03:16:35,489 --> 03:16:38,038
the rise and fall of empires.

5309
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:40,056
You have a really great lecture series called

5310
03:16:40,057 --> 03:16:43,830
"The Decisive Battles of World History,"

5311
03:16:43,829 --> 03:16:45,629
which is another fascinating perspective

5312
03:16:45,629 --> 03:16:47,579
to look at world's history.

5313
03:16:47,579 --> 03:16:50,219
What makes a battle decisive?

5314
03:16:50,219 --> 03:16:51,269
- The easiest definition

5315
03:16:51,270 --> 03:16:54,299
is it causes an immediate change

5316
03:16:54,299 --> 03:16:56,279
in political structure.

5317
03:16:56,280 --> 03:16:57,750
So who's in charge?

5318
03:16:57,750 --> 03:17:00,450
So the classic decisive political battle

5319
03:17:00,450 --> 03:17:03,659
is Alexander beats King Darius III

5320
03:17:03,659 --> 03:17:05,189
at the Battle of Gaugamela.

5321
03:17:05,190 --> 03:17:06,510
And in that moment,

5322
03:17:06,510 --> 03:17:10,710
we switch from the ruler of the entire huge Persian Empire

5323
03:17:10,709 --> 03:17:11,819
being Darius

5324
03:17:11,819 --> 03:17:13,349
to now being Alexander.

5325
03:17:13,350 --> 03:17:14,519
From it being Persian

5326
03:17:14,520 --> 03:17:16,380
to being controlled by the Macedonians.

5327
03:17:16,379 --> 03:17:18,298
So there is a one afternoon

5328
03:17:18,299 --> 03:17:20,279
has this dramatic switch over

5329
03:17:20,280 --> 03:17:22,949
a enormous geographic area, right?

5330
03:17:22,950 --> 03:17:24,570
So that's a decisive battle

5331
03:17:24,569 --> 03:17:27,089
in that you see that immediate change.

5332
03:17:27,090 --> 03:17:28,860
Other types of decisive battles

5333
03:17:28,860 --> 03:17:32,279
are ones that might have more unforeseen long-term effects.

5334
03:17:32,280 --> 03:17:34,889
You know, you may not realize this is decisive at the time,

5335
03:17:34,889 --> 03:17:37,529
but from a longer perspective, it is.

5336
03:17:37,530 --> 03:17:40,829
And often those are ones that either

5337
03:17:40,829 --> 03:17:43,529
allow some new people

5338
03:17:43,530 --> 03:17:46,679
or idea or institution

5339
03:17:46,680 --> 03:17:50,249
to either grow or have its growth curbed.

5340
03:17:50,250 --> 03:17:51,570
So at various points,

5341
03:17:51,569 --> 03:17:53,519
we have, you know, empires that were expanding

5342
03:17:53,520 --> 03:17:56,040
and basically were stopped at some battle.

5343
03:17:56,040 --> 03:17:57,719
And so you say, well, if they hadn't been stopped there,

5344
03:17:57,719 --> 03:18:00,268
they might have gone on to dominate this whole area.

5345
03:18:00,270 --> 03:18:05,100
Or conversely, you know, you could say Rome wasn't,

5346
03:18:05,100 --> 03:18:07,950
they were one place before the Second Punic War,

5347
03:18:07,950 --> 03:18:10,829
after the Second Punic War, they were this dominant force.

5348
03:18:10,829 --> 03:18:11,812
So you could pick one of those battles

5349
03:18:11,813 --> 03:18:13,319
and say that was decisive

5350
03:18:13,319 --> 03:18:15,749
in setting them on this new path.

5351
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:18,629
- It's also an opportunity to demonstrate a new technology,

5352
03:18:18,629 --> 03:18:20,609
and if that technology is effective-

5353
03:18:20,610 --> 03:18:22,230
- Yes. - it changes history

5354
03:18:22,229 --> 03:18:26,639
because that was done as either tactical

5355
03:18:26,639 --> 03:18:29,909
or literally the technology used.

5356
03:18:29,909 --> 03:18:32,339
So how important is technology,

5357
03:18:32,340 --> 03:18:34,650
the technological advantage in war?

5358
03:18:34,649 --> 03:18:37,408
- Huge. I mean, the history of warfare

5359
03:18:37,409 --> 03:18:41,099
is basically the history of technological change often.

5360
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:43,769
So, I mean, there's all the great moments of transition.

5361
03:18:43,770 --> 03:18:45,419
For a long time, we fought with,

5362
03:18:45,420 --> 03:18:47,250
you know, hand to hand,

5363
03:18:47,250 --> 03:18:48,782
with metal weapons,

5364
03:18:49,709 --> 03:18:52,168
then you start to have the gunpowder revolution,

5365
03:18:52,170 --> 03:18:54,870
which causes all sorts of shifts there.

5366
03:18:54,870 --> 03:18:56,999
You know, there's big changes.

5367
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:58,860
Planes, when they become a huge force.

5368
03:18:58,860 --> 03:19:01,619
I mean, World War II is this crazy time

5369
03:19:01,620 --> 03:19:04,110
where planes go from literally biplanes,

5370
03:19:04,110 --> 03:19:06,869
you know, string and wood, to jets,

5371
03:19:06,870 --> 03:19:08,013
four years later.

5372
03:19:09,239 --> 03:19:10,468
So that's this moment

5373
03:19:10,469 --> 03:19:12,808
of incredibly fast technological change.

5374
03:19:12,809 --> 03:19:13,889
You know, going into World War II,

5375
03:19:13,889 --> 03:19:15,599
everybody thinks it's all about battleships,

5376
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:17,340
who's got the biggest battleships.

5377
03:19:17,340 --> 03:19:18,240
Four years later,

5378
03:19:18,239 --> 03:19:19,707
battleships are just junk.

5379
03:19:19,708 --> 03:19:21,450
Let's just scrap 'em.

5380
03:19:21,450 --> 03:19:23,070
It's all about aircraft and carriers.

5381
03:19:23,069 --> 03:19:25,859
And that's everything war at sea.

5382
03:19:25,860 --> 03:19:27,390
So you have these moments of,

5383
03:19:27,389 --> 03:19:28,409
particularly in warfare,

5384
03:19:28,409 --> 03:19:30,598
almost accelerated technological change

5385
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:33,780
where things happen very rapidly

5386
03:19:33,780 --> 03:19:36,210
and the civilization

5387
03:19:36,209 --> 03:19:37,829
or the nation or the army

5388
03:19:37,829 --> 03:19:41,159
that adapts more quickly to the new technology

5389
03:19:41,159 --> 03:19:42,808
will often be the one that wins.

5390
03:19:42,809 --> 03:19:44,279
And we've seen that story

5391
03:19:44,280 --> 03:19:46,562
over and over and over again in history.

5392
03:19:47,700 --> 03:19:49,619
- It's also interesting how much geography

5393
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:51,509
that you mentioned a few times

5394
03:19:51,510 --> 03:19:54,329
affects wars.

5395
03:19:54,329 --> 03:19:55,498
The result of wars,

5396
03:19:55,500 --> 03:19:57,959
the rise and fall of empires,

5397
03:19:57,959 --> 03:20:00,119
all of it, as silly as it is,

5398
03:20:00,120 --> 03:20:01,590
it's not the people or the technology,

5399
03:20:01,590 --> 03:20:02,819
it's like, sometimes, like literally,

5400
03:20:02,819 --> 03:20:04,258
that there's rivers.

5401
03:20:04,260 --> 03:20:07,340
- I think there's a real geographic determinism

5402
03:20:07,340 --> 03:20:09,300
to civilization itself.

5403
03:20:09,299 --> 03:20:12,299
I mean, you know, if you look at where civilization arose,

5404
03:20:12,299 --> 03:20:13,619
it's in Mesopotamia

5405
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:16,050
in sort of a swampy land between two rivers.

5406
03:20:16,049 --> 03:20:18,178
It's in the Nile River Delta,

5407
03:20:18,180 --> 03:20:20,189
where it's the same situation.

5408
03:20:20,190 --> 03:20:21,450
It's in the Indus River

5409
03:20:21,450 --> 03:20:22,500
where you have the same thing.

5410
03:20:22,500 --> 03:20:23,909
And it's along the Yellow Rivers

5411
03:20:23,909 --> 03:20:24,959
and the Yangtze Rivers

5412
03:20:24,959 --> 03:20:26,309
where it's the same thing.

5413
03:20:26,309 --> 03:20:29,128
So I mean, that is geographically determined

5414
03:20:29,129 --> 03:20:31,439
where those great civilizations

5415
03:20:31,440 --> 03:20:33,273
of, you know, Asia,

5416
03:20:34,139 --> 03:20:36,208
you know, or Europe are gonna arise

5417
03:20:36,209 --> 03:20:38,758
is it's very much determined by that.

5418
03:20:38,760 --> 03:20:41,359
And often, the course of history

5419
03:20:41,359 --> 03:20:44,730
has that strong geographical determination.

5420
03:20:44,729 --> 03:20:47,128
I mean, you can argue that all of Egyptian,

5421
03:20:47,129 --> 03:20:49,769
Ancient Egyptian society,

5422
03:20:49,770 --> 03:20:54,480
is kind of based around the cycle of the Nile flood

5423
03:20:54,479 --> 03:20:56,368
because it was so predictable,

5424
03:20:56,370 --> 03:20:57,930
and everything depended on it,

5425
03:20:57,930 --> 03:21:00,596
and their whole religion actually develops around that.

5426
03:21:00,596 --> 03:21:02,789
And in Mesopotamia, the same thing.

5427
03:21:02,790 --> 03:21:04,320
The way their religion develops

5428
03:21:04,319 --> 03:21:08,429
is a reaction to the particular geographic environment

5429
03:21:08,430 --> 03:21:10,709
that those people grew up in.

5430
03:21:10,709 --> 03:21:15,058
So that's a very profound influence on civilization.

5431
03:21:15,059 --> 03:21:17,099
One of my professors once said to me,

5432
03:21:17,100 --> 03:21:20,220
the best map of the Roman Empire

5433
03:21:20,219 --> 03:21:22,739
isn't any of these maps with political borders.

5434
03:21:22,739 --> 03:21:25,439
It would be a map that shows the zone

5435
03:21:25,440 --> 03:21:28,589
in which it's possible to cultivate olives.

5436
03:21:28,590 --> 03:21:30,420
So if you simply get a map

5437
03:21:30,420 --> 03:21:32,940
and map onto it where you could grow olives

5438
03:21:32,940 --> 03:21:33,960
during this time,

5439
03:21:33,959 --> 03:21:36,179
let's say 1st century AD,

5440
03:21:36,180 --> 03:21:38,550
it corresponds exactly,

5441
03:21:38,549 --> 03:21:40,558
I mean, really closely

5442
03:21:40,559 --> 03:21:43,889
to the areas that are most heavily Romanized.

5443
03:21:43,889 --> 03:21:47,098
Now, I'm not gonna say that, you know,

5444
03:21:47,100 --> 03:21:48,180
but there is something to that.

5445
03:21:48,180 --> 03:21:50,550
Where Roman culture spread successfully

5446
03:21:50,549 --> 03:21:53,461
is where people grow the same crops.

5447
03:21:54,329 --> 03:21:56,849
And that's just one of those fundamental things.

5448
03:21:56,850 --> 03:21:59,160
- Yeah, I mean, you so beautifully put

5449
03:21:59,159 --> 03:22:02,339
that the perspective can change dramatically

5450
03:22:02,340 --> 03:22:04,106
how you see history.

5451
03:22:04,105 --> 03:22:07,138
I mean, you could probably tell world history through what?

5452
03:22:07,139 --> 03:22:09,449
Through olives, cinnamon, and gold.

5453
03:22:09,450 --> 03:22:10,290
- Uh-huh.

5454
03:22:10,290 --> 03:22:11,580
Yeah. That's become really trendy

5455
03:22:11,579 --> 03:22:13,049
is to look at history through objects.

5456
03:22:13,049 --> 03:22:14,728
And I mean, for the Romans,

5457
03:22:14,729 --> 03:22:16,979
diet is huge.

5458
03:22:16,979 --> 03:22:17,812
I mean, you know,

5459
03:22:17,813 --> 03:22:20,220
probably 80% of of the people in their own world

5460
03:22:20,219 --> 03:22:23,611
ate basically a diet of olive oil, wine,

5461
03:22:26,219 --> 03:22:27,628
and wheat, right?

5462
03:22:27,629 --> 03:22:29,339
That those three crops

5463
03:22:29,340 --> 03:22:32,580
are the basic crops that they subsisted on.

5464
03:22:32,579 --> 03:22:35,819
And just the way you have to grow those crops,

5465
03:22:35,819 --> 03:22:37,349
where you grow them,

5466
03:22:37,350 --> 03:22:40,290
that dictates so much, you know, about culture.

5467
03:22:40,290 --> 03:22:42,270
And the Romans saw it that way.

5468
03:22:42,270 --> 03:22:44,910
One of my favorite documents from the ancient world...

5469
03:22:44,909 --> 03:22:47,248
And they defined civilization that way.

5470
03:22:47,250 --> 03:22:50,459
So the Romans, civilized people ate those crops

5471
03:22:50,459 --> 03:22:53,729
and non-civilized people ate different food.

5472
03:22:53,729 --> 03:22:56,758
So there's this letter from a Greek

5473
03:22:56,760 --> 03:22:59,820
who was serving as an administrator in the Roman government.

5474
03:22:59,819 --> 03:23:02,638
And he gets posted to Germany.

5475
03:23:02,639 --> 03:23:04,648
Okay? To the far north.

5476
03:23:04,649 --> 03:23:06,809
And he writes these pathetic letters

5477
03:23:06,809 --> 03:23:08,526
back home to his family, saying,

5478
03:23:08,527 --> 03:23:12,360
"The inhabitants here lead the most wretched existence

5479
03:23:12,360 --> 03:23:14,160
of all mankind

5480
03:23:14,159 --> 03:23:16,019
for they cultivate no olives

5481
03:23:16,020 --> 03:23:18,359
and they grow no grapes."

5482
03:23:18,360 --> 03:23:20,819
So to him, that was hell. - Yeah.

5483
03:23:20,819 --> 03:23:21,988
- Being posted to an area

5484
03:23:21,989 --> 03:23:24,868
where they eat these terrible foreign foods.

5485
03:23:24,870 --> 03:23:27,050
And of course the cliche for the Romans

5486
03:23:27,049 --> 03:23:30,328
of what barbarians eat is red meat.

5487
03:23:30,329 --> 03:23:32,489
They're herders, so they're not farmers,

5488
03:23:32,489 --> 03:23:34,109
but they follow herds of cow around,

5489
03:23:34,110 --> 03:23:35,730
which a totally different lifestyle.

5490
03:23:35,729 --> 03:23:37,982
They eat dairy products and they drink beer.

5491
03:23:39,209 --> 03:23:41,659
And I tell my two students sometimes that, you know,

5492
03:23:41,659 --> 03:23:43,888
if you were to stick a Roman in a time machine

5493
03:23:43,889 --> 03:23:45,479
and send them to where we live,

5494
03:23:45,479 --> 03:23:47,158
which I teach in Wisconsin,

5495
03:23:47,159 --> 03:23:48,719
Green Bay, Wisconsin,

5496
03:23:48,719 --> 03:23:50,579
that Roman would step out, look around,

5497
03:23:50,579 --> 03:23:51,412
see all the beer,

5498
03:23:51,413 --> 03:23:52,980
the broths, and the cheese,

5499
03:23:52,979 --> 03:23:55,048
and say, "I know who you guys are.

5500
03:23:55,049 --> 03:23:56,669
- Yeah. - You're barbarians.

5501
03:23:56,670 --> 03:23:57,839
- Barbarians.

5502
03:23:57,840 --> 03:23:59,940
That's another way to draw the boundary

5503
03:23:59,940 --> 03:24:01,530
between olive oil, wine, and wheat

5504
03:24:01,530 --> 03:24:03,120
and meat, dairy, and beer.

5505
03:24:03,120 --> 03:24:04,230
- But it's more fundamental

5506
03:24:04,229 --> 03:24:06,298
because it's different forms of life.

5507
03:24:06,299 --> 03:24:08,339
- Yeah. - Because if you're a farmer,

5508
03:24:08,340 --> 03:24:09,600
you grow certain crops.

5509
03:24:09,600 --> 03:24:10,530
And if you're a farmer,

5510
03:24:10,530 --> 03:24:11,820
you tend to stay in one place,

5511
03:24:11,819 --> 03:24:13,198
you tend to build cities.

5512
03:24:13,200 --> 03:24:15,749
If you're following herds of cows around,

5513
03:24:15,750 --> 03:24:17,580
you don't build cities.

5514
03:24:17,579 --> 03:24:19,498
You have a totally different lifestyle.

5515
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:20,970
So it's diet,

5516
03:24:20,969 --> 03:24:23,759
but it's more fundamental underlying things

5517
03:24:23,760 --> 03:24:25,380
about your entire culture.

5518
03:24:25,379 --> 03:24:28,919
- And many of the barbarians were nomadic tribes.

5519
03:24:28,920 --> 03:24:31,350
- Some of them were, yeah, definitely.

5520
03:24:31,350 --> 03:24:33,330
- Fascinating. I mean, this is just

5521
03:24:33,329 --> 03:24:35,039
yet another fascinating way to-

5522
03:24:35,040 --> 03:24:37,589
- Dietary determinism, geographic determinism,

5523
03:24:37,590 --> 03:24:39,060
yeah, these things are big.

5524
03:24:39,059 --> 03:24:40,228
- On the topic of war,

5525
03:24:40,229 --> 03:24:43,979
it may be a ridiculous span of time and scale,

5526
03:24:43,979 --> 03:24:47,389
but how do you think the world wars

5527
03:24:47,389 --> 03:24:50,248
of the 20th century compare

5528
03:24:50,250 --> 03:24:52,709
to the wars that we've been talking about,

5529
03:24:52,709 --> 03:24:55,738
of the Roman Empire, of Greece, and so on?

5530
03:24:55,739 --> 03:24:57,599
- I mean, what's interesting about

5531
03:24:57,600 --> 03:25:00,930
some of the Roman civil wars, particularly,

5532
03:25:00,930 --> 03:25:03,990
is that they are world wars at the time.

5533
03:25:03,989 --> 03:25:06,178
So let's take the war

5534
03:25:06,180 --> 03:25:07,890
after the assassination of Julius Caesar.

5535
03:25:07,889 --> 03:25:09,599
We've talked about that one a lot.

5536
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:10,433
That was fought,

5537
03:25:10,433 --> 03:25:12,809
there were battles there fought in Spain,

5538
03:25:12,809 --> 03:25:14,818
in North Africa, in Greece,

5539
03:25:14,819 --> 03:25:16,498
in Egypt, in Italy.

5540
03:25:16,500 --> 03:25:18,689
I mean, truly, across the entire breadth

5541
03:25:18,690 --> 03:25:19,710
of the Mediterranean,

5542
03:25:19,709 --> 03:25:21,838
involving at least seven or eight

5543
03:25:21,840 --> 03:25:24,270
different factions of Romans.

5544
03:25:24,270 --> 03:25:26,003
And that was the world to them.

5545
03:25:26,003 --> 03:25:27,840
I mean, that's very similar in a way

5546
03:25:27,840 --> 03:25:29,580
to our modern world wars,

5547
03:25:29,579 --> 03:25:31,619
where this was a global conflict,

5548
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:34,620
at least, as they envisioned the world they knew of.

5549
03:25:34,620 --> 03:25:35,640
And if we sort of, I don't know,

5550
03:25:35,639 --> 03:25:36,929
somehow factor for,

5551
03:25:36,930 --> 03:25:39,119
you know, transportation time,

5552
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:40,200
I mean, I think you can argue

5553
03:25:40,200 --> 03:25:43,920
that that was a bigger war than World War II.

5554
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:45,299
I mean, in World War II,

5555
03:25:45,299 --> 03:25:46,678
if you hopped on a plane,

5556
03:25:46,680 --> 03:25:48,840
you could get from the US to China

5557
03:25:48,840 --> 03:25:50,817
in, you know, in a week or something, right?

5558
03:25:50,816 --> 03:25:52,161
In little hops.

5559
03:25:52,162 --> 03:25:53,130
I mean, in the ancient world,

5560
03:25:53,129 --> 03:25:55,859
if you wanted to go from Spain to Egypt,

5561
03:25:55,860 --> 03:25:57,360
it would take you a month.

5562
03:25:57,360 --> 03:26:02,249
So they were fighting across a larger space time zone

5563
03:26:02,250 --> 03:26:04,500
in terms of their technology to move

5564
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:05,909
than World War II took place across.

5565
03:26:05,909 --> 03:26:08,137
- So for instance, World War II was

5566
03:26:08,138 --> 03:26:09,793
quiet contained. - Smaller. Yeah.

5567
03:26:09,792 --> 03:26:12,299
I mean, if we adjust for that sort of factor.

5568
03:26:12,299 --> 03:26:13,646
So that was a global war,

5569
03:26:13,647 --> 03:26:15,647
and I think that would be very familiar.

5570
03:26:16,829 --> 03:26:19,889
- How do you think the atomic bomb,

5571
03:26:19,889 --> 03:26:22,202
nuclear weapons change war?

5572
03:26:23,370 --> 03:26:24,900
- Yeah, I mean, that's the,

5573
03:26:24,899 --> 03:26:28,198
now we can destroy the world

5574
03:26:28,200 --> 03:26:31,709
and truly kind of destroy civilizations wholesale,

5575
03:26:31,709 --> 03:26:34,378
and that does seem to be a new thing.

5576
03:26:34,379 --> 03:26:37,408
I mean, no matter what the Romans do, did,

5577
03:26:37,409 --> 03:26:39,058
they didn't have that choice,

5578
03:26:39,059 --> 03:26:39,906
that ability to think,

5579
03:26:39,906 --> 03:26:42,752
"I can do something that will end,

5580
03:26:43,860 --> 03:26:45,330
you know, life as we know it,

5581
03:26:45,329 --> 03:26:47,125
at least, on the planet."

5582
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:50,582
And that's a very different perspective.

5583
03:26:51,959 --> 03:26:54,051
And it's, I think, weird and interesting moment right now.

5584
03:26:54,052 --> 03:26:56,669
I mean, I'm getting way beyond ancient history here,

5585
03:26:56,670 --> 03:26:57,839
but, you know, for a long time,

5586
03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:00,869
we had this sort of stasis with the nuclear standoff,

5587
03:27:00,870 --> 03:27:03,390
with mutually assured destruction

5588
03:27:03,389 --> 03:27:06,839
between this US sort of block of nations

5589
03:27:06,840 --> 03:27:08,729
and the Soviet ones.

5590
03:27:08,729 --> 03:27:09,716
And it worked,

5591
03:27:09,717 --> 03:27:12,570
and now we're entering this kind of time

5592
03:27:12,569 --> 03:27:13,948
when a lot more countries

5593
03:27:13,950 --> 03:27:16,530
are gonna start becoming nuclear capable.

5594
03:27:16,530 --> 03:27:17,939
We might have a resurgence

5595
03:27:17,940 --> 03:27:20,399
of just building new weapons platforms,

5596
03:27:20,399 --> 03:27:22,288
with China seems very eager

5597
03:27:22,290 --> 03:27:24,060
to expand their nuclear arsenal

5598
03:27:24,059 --> 03:27:25,438
in all sorts of ways.

5599
03:27:25,440 --> 03:27:29,279
So it's a unnerving time, let's say, right now.

5600
03:27:29,280 --> 03:27:31,530
- And it's a terrifying experiment

5601
03:27:31,530 --> 03:27:34,679
to find out if nuclear weapons,

5602
03:27:34,680 --> 03:27:36,510
when a lot of nations have nuclear weapons,

5603
03:27:36,510 --> 03:27:40,627
is that going to enforce civility and peace

5604
03:27:40,627 --> 03:27:42,719
or is it going to be a destabilizing

5605
03:27:42,719 --> 03:27:44,579
and, ultimately, civilization destroying?

5606
03:27:44,579 --> 03:27:46,889
- Right. I mean, it was weirdly stable

5607
03:27:46,889 --> 03:27:48,479
when it was a bipolar world,

5608
03:27:48,479 --> 03:27:50,339
where you had just sort of those two blocks.

5609
03:27:50,340 --> 03:27:52,710
Now, with a multipolar world

5610
03:27:52,709 --> 03:27:54,778
with access to these weapons, I don't know.

5611
03:27:54,780 --> 03:27:56,760
I mean, we're kind of jumping out the ancient world,

5612
03:27:56,760 --> 03:27:58,649
but I'll tell you one thing that's always fascinated me

5613
03:27:58,649 --> 03:28:01,198
in this sort of comparison, ancient-modern,

5614
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:05,099
is how people don't learn the lessons of the past

5615
03:28:05,100 --> 03:28:06,539
in military history.

5616
03:28:06,540 --> 03:28:08,189
And the very specific example

5617
03:28:08,190 --> 03:28:11,160
that in my lifetime I've seen play out twice

5618
03:28:11,159 --> 03:28:13,589
is, just certain places,

5619
03:28:13,590 --> 03:28:15,750
people make the same mistakes over and over again.

5620
03:28:15,750 --> 03:28:19,319
So a nice example is Afghanistan.

5621
03:28:19,319 --> 03:28:21,988
Or roughly, that sort of Northern Pakistan

5622
03:28:21,989 --> 03:28:24,448
slash into what is Afghanistan.

5623
03:28:24,450 --> 03:28:27,390
I mean, that is a geographic region

5624
03:28:27,389 --> 03:28:29,609
that over and over again,

5625
03:28:29,610 --> 03:28:32,969
the best, most sophisticated armies in the world

5626
03:28:32,969 --> 03:28:36,689
have invaded and have met horrible failure.

5627
03:28:36,690 --> 03:28:38,400
And that goes all the way back to, you know,

5628
03:28:38,399 --> 03:28:41,698
Alexander the Great tried to conquer that area,

5629
03:28:41,700 --> 03:28:43,650
the Mongols tried to do it,

5630
03:28:43,649 --> 03:28:45,209
the Huns tried to do it,

5631
03:28:45,209 --> 03:28:47,699
the Moguls tried to do it,

5632
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:50,459
you know, Victorian Britain tried to do it,

5633
03:28:50,459 --> 03:28:52,439
the Russians tried to do it,

5634
03:28:52,440 --> 03:28:54,089
the Americans tried to do it,

5635
03:28:54,090 --> 03:28:56,909
and they made the very same mistakes

5636
03:28:56,909 --> 03:28:59,069
over and over and over again.

5637
03:28:59,069 --> 03:29:02,009
And the two mistakes are not understanding the terrain,

5638
03:29:02,010 --> 03:29:04,740
that it's a rocky mountainous area,

5639
03:29:04,739 --> 03:29:07,529
that people can always hide in caves;

5640
03:29:07,530 --> 03:29:08,640
and it's not understanding

5641
03:29:08,639 --> 03:29:11,609
the fundamentally tribal nature of that area,

5642
03:29:11,610 --> 03:29:13,739
that that's where the real allegiance is,

5643
03:29:13,739 --> 03:29:14,878
is in these tribes,

5644
03:29:14,879 --> 03:29:17,099
it's not an a centralized government.

5645
03:29:17,100 --> 03:29:19,350
And that's the same error Alexander made

5646
03:29:19,350 --> 03:29:21,600
as, you know, the British made

5647
03:29:21,600 --> 03:29:23,249
in the 19th century,

5648
03:29:23,250 --> 03:29:25,649
as the Russians, as the Americans.

5649
03:29:25,649 --> 03:29:27,568
And it's just, it's so depressing

5650
03:29:27,569 --> 03:29:30,509
as a historian who studies history

5651
03:29:30,510 --> 03:29:33,510
to see these things being repeated over and over again

5652
03:29:33,510 --> 03:29:36,269
and you know exactly what's gonna happen.

5653
03:29:36,270 --> 03:29:40,080
- For leaders not to be learning lessons of history,

5654
03:29:40,079 --> 03:29:44,106
you co-wrote a book precisely on this topic,

5655
03:29:44,106 --> 03:29:46,558
"The Long Shadow of Antiquity:

5656
03:29:46,559 --> 03:29:49,799
What Have the Greeks and Romans Done For Us?"

5657
03:29:49,799 --> 03:29:52,828
What are some key elements of antiquity

5658
03:29:52,829 --> 03:29:55,018
that are reflected in the modern world?

5659
03:29:55,020 --> 03:29:57,870
- Yeah, it's a book that my wife and I wrote together,

5660
03:29:57,870 --> 03:30:01,956
and it is trying to make people understand

5661
03:30:04,709 --> 03:30:08,548
how deeply rooted our current actions

5662
03:30:08,549 --> 03:30:09,599
in almost every way.

5663
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:11,640
Even things that we think are just

5664
03:30:11,639 --> 03:30:15,449
in truly unique parts of our culture

5665
03:30:15,450 --> 03:30:18,209
or things that we think are just innate to human nature

5666
03:30:18,209 --> 03:30:19,858
are actually rooted in the past.

5667
03:30:19,860 --> 03:30:22,259
So this is another power of the past thing.

5668
03:30:22,260 --> 03:30:25,769
And this is just a long specific list of examples, really.

5669
03:30:25,770 --> 03:30:27,360
So, I mean, we go through government

5670
03:30:27,360 --> 03:30:29,759
and education and intellectual stuff

5671
03:30:29,760 --> 03:30:31,110
and art and architecture

5672
03:30:31,110 --> 03:30:32,364
and, you know, a lot of the things

5673
03:30:32,364 --> 03:30:34,289
that we've been talking about today.

5674
03:30:34,290 --> 03:30:37,530
Language, culture, medicine.

5675
03:30:37,530 --> 03:30:39,719
But even things like, you know, habits.

5676
03:30:39,719 --> 03:30:42,268
The way we celebrate things, the way we get married.

5677
03:30:42,270 --> 03:30:43,919
Our married rituals have all sorts of things

5678
03:30:43,920 --> 03:30:46,020
in common with Roman weddings.

5679
03:30:46,020 --> 03:30:48,450
- The calendar. - The calendar.

5680
03:30:48,450 --> 03:30:49,283
The words.

5681
03:30:49,282 --> 03:30:50,729
We're using Julius Caesar's calendar.

5682
03:30:50,729 --> 03:30:52,889
I mean, Pope Gregory did one tiny little twist,

5683
03:30:52,889 --> 03:30:54,419
but Caesar's the one who basically came up

5684
03:30:54,420 --> 03:30:55,320
with our current calendar,

5685
03:30:55,319 --> 03:30:58,019
with 365 days, 12 months,

5686
03:30:58,020 --> 03:30:59,433
leap years, all that.

5687
03:31:00,299 --> 03:31:02,939
You know, so we're living in law.

5688
03:31:02,940 --> 03:31:05,790
There's just no way to escape the power of the past.

5689
03:31:05,790 --> 03:31:08,879
And what I believe very ardently

5690
03:31:08,879 --> 03:31:13,199
is that you can't make good decisions in the present

5691
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:15,869
and you can't make good decisions about the future

5692
03:31:15,870 --> 03:31:17,820
without understanding the past.

5693
03:31:17,819 --> 03:31:19,738
And that's not just true with your own life,

5694
03:31:19,739 --> 03:31:21,299
but it's in understanding others.

5695
03:31:21,299 --> 03:31:23,443
So it's not only your own past you have to understand,

5696
03:31:23,443 --> 03:31:24,779
but you have to understand other people,

5697
03:31:24,780 --> 03:31:26,280
what's influencing them.

5698
03:31:26,280 --> 03:31:28,199
So you can't interact with others

5699
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:30,269
unless you understand where they're coming from.

5700
03:31:30,270 --> 03:31:31,649
And the answer to where they're coming from

5701
03:31:31,649 --> 03:31:33,658
is where they came from,

5702
03:31:33,659 --> 03:31:34,949
and what shaped them,

5703
03:31:34,950 --> 03:31:36,900
and what forces affect them.

5704
03:31:36,899 --> 03:31:38,818
So I think it's absolutely vital

5705
03:31:38,819 --> 03:31:41,339
to have some understanding of the past

5706
03:31:41,340 --> 03:31:45,780
in order to make competent decisions in the present.

5707
03:31:45,780 --> 03:31:46,890
- What are some of the problems

5708
03:31:46,889 --> 03:31:51,268
when we try to gain lessons from history and look back?

5709
03:31:51,270 --> 03:31:53,310
We've spoken about them a bit,

5710
03:31:53,309 --> 03:31:54,782
the bias of the historian.

5711
03:31:55,979 --> 03:31:59,818
Maybe what are the problems in studying history

5712
03:31:59,819 --> 03:32:01,859
and how do we avoid them?

5713
03:32:01,860 --> 03:32:06,860
- Probably, the biggest problems are the sources themselves,

5714
03:32:08,010 --> 03:32:10,110
the incompleteness of them.

5715
03:32:10,110 --> 03:32:13,679
And this gets more intense the farther back we go in time.

5716
03:32:13,680 --> 03:32:15,486
- Yes. - So, if you say,

5717
03:32:15,486 --> 03:32:18,239
"I wanna write a book about the 19th century."

5718
03:32:18,239 --> 03:32:20,128
There is more material available

5719
03:32:20,129 --> 03:32:21,869
for almost any topic you want to pick

5720
03:32:21,870 --> 03:32:24,689
than you could possibly go through in your lifetime.

5721
03:32:24,690 --> 03:32:27,839
If you say, "I wanna write a book about the Roman world,"

5722
03:32:27,840 --> 03:32:30,119
this is a very different thing.

5723
03:32:30,120 --> 03:32:32,220
In my office, I have a bookshelf

5724
03:32:32,219 --> 03:32:33,059
that's, I don't know,

5725
03:32:33,059 --> 03:32:35,398
eight feet high, 10 feet wide,

5726
03:32:35,399 --> 03:32:39,929
and it contains pretty much all the main surviving

5727
03:32:39,930 --> 03:32:43,652
Greek and Roman literary texts.

5728
03:32:43,653 --> 03:32:45,510
- Okay. Wow. Wow. - One bookshelf.

5729
03:32:45,510 --> 03:32:47,340
It's a big bookshelf. - Yeah.

5730
03:32:47,340 --> 03:32:49,529
- But that's what we use to interpret this world.

5731
03:32:49,530 --> 03:32:51,270
Now, there's a lot of other types of texts.

5732
03:32:51,270 --> 03:32:53,279
There's, you know, papyri,

5733
03:32:53,280 --> 03:32:54,150
there's all sorts of things,

5734
03:32:54,149 --> 03:32:55,439
there's inscriptions,

5735
03:32:55,440 --> 03:32:56,910
there's archeological evidence.

5736
03:32:56,909 --> 03:32:58,798
So there's other stuff.

5737
03:32:58,799 --> 03:33:00,569
But honestly, you know,

5738
03:33:00,569 --> 03:33:05,569
99% of things about the world I study are lost.

5739
03:33:07,319 --> 03:33:10,259
Then you get into all the issues are, you know,

5740
03:33:10,260 --> 03:33:12,840
is what we have surviving a representative example?

5741
03:33:12,840 --> 03:33:14,219
We know it's not.

5742
03:33:14,219 --> 03:33:15,658
For example, all the literary texts

5743
03:33:15,659 --> 03:33:18,242
are written by one tiny group, elite males.

5744
03:33:19,260 --> 03:33:21,659
So that's a problem there.

5745
03:33:21,659 --> 03:33:23,068
There's the problem of bias.

5746
03:33:23,069 --> 03:33:25,360
We know that they're not necessarily telling us the truth.

5747
03:33:25,361 --> 03:33:27,779
They have an agenda, you know.

5748
03:33:27,780 --> 03:33:29,940
They're representing history in a certain way

5749
03:33:29,940 --> 03:33:31,770
to achieve certain things.

5750
03:33:31,770 --> 03:33:33,540
Then there's the problem of transmission.

5751
03:33:33,540 --> 03:33:35,669
I mean, all those texts are copies of copies

5752
03:33:35,670 --> 03:33:37,049
of copies of copies.

5753
03:33:37,049 --> 03:33:38,399
And everybody knows that game where, you know,

5754
03:33:38,399 --> 03:33:40,019
you whisper a sentence to someone

5755
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:41,010
and then go around the room.

5756
03:33:41,010 --> 03:33:43,110
Are you gonna get that same sentence back?

5757
03:33:43,110 --> 03:33:44,670
Well, every ancient text we have

5758
03:33:44,670 --> 03:33:46,172
has gone through that process.

5759
03:33:47,430 --> 03:33:48,990
So this is a real problem.

5760
03:33:48,989 --> 03:33:51,359
And that's just with the sources, right?

5761
03:33:51,360 --> 03:33:53,790
And this is the historic era.

5762
03:33:53,790 --> 03:33:56,249
When you move back just a little earlier

5763
03:33:56,250 --> 03:33:59,040
to the prehistoric era or to civilizations

5764
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:01,350
that don't have written sources surviving?

5765
03:34:01,350 --> 03:34:04,229
And some of these are ancient Mediterranean ones.

5766
03:34:04,229 --> 03:34:05,612
I mean, anything goes.

5767
03:34:06,450 --> 03:34:09,030
I mean, one of the jokes is that museums,

5768
03:34:09,030 --> 03:34:10,140
archeological museums,

5769
03:34:10,139 --> 03:34:11,368
are full of objects

5770
03:34:11,370 --> 03:34:14,399
which are labeled cult object.

5771
03:34:14,399 --> 03:34:16,259
It's some religious object.

5772
03:34:16,260 --> 03:34:18,179
And I think the honest label

5773
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:19,476
that should be on that thing is

5774
03:34:19,477 --> 03:34:21,450
"We have no idea what the hell this is,

5775
03:34:21,450 --> 03:34:23,369
but I wanna believe it's something important,

5776
03:34:23,370 --> 03:34:25,559
so I'm gonna say it's a religious object."

5777
03:34:25,559 --> 03:34:26,579
But in reality, you know,

5778
03:34:26,579 --> 03:34:28,889
it's an ancient toilet paper roll holder,

5779
03:34:28,889 --> 03:34:29,722
or something. - Yeah.

5780
03:34:29,722 --> 03:34:34,018
And it's a huge problem when you try to interpret

5781
03:34:34,020 --> 03:34:37,799
a civilization without written texts.

5782
03:34:37,799 --> 03:34:39,448
And my favorite little story

5783
03:34:39,450 --> 03:34:41,499
that kind of illustrates this is

5784
03:34:42,600 --> 03:34:45,120
in the 19th century, this German,

5785
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:46,607
who had gone to school in England, okay,

5786
03:34:46,606 --> 03:34:48,989
one of the best educated guys of his time,

5787
03:34:48,989 --> 03:34:50,249
goes to North Africa

5788
03:34:50,250 --> 03:34:52,259
and is poking around in the desert.

5789
03:34:52,260 --> 03:34:56,639
And he finds this site with these huge stone monoliths,

5790
03:34:56,639 --> 03:34:59,279
10 feet tall, in pairs.

5791
03:34:59,280 --> 03:35:01,619
And there's a lintel stone across the top.

5792
03:35:01,620 --> 03:35:04,320
So sort of like big, you know, two posts

5793
03:35:04,319 --> 03:35:05,698
with a stone across the top.

5794
03:35:05,700 --> 03:35:08,263
And there's a big stone in front of them too.

5795
03:35:08,263 --> 03:35:09,537
And so he looks at this stuff

5796
03:35:09,537 --> 03:35:13,170
and he says, "Well, what does this remind me of?"

5797
03:35:13,170 --> 03:35:15,537
It reminds me of Stonehenge, right?

5798
03:35:15,537 --> 03:35:16,680
And there's even a site

5799
03:35:16,680 --> 03:35:17,909
where there's multiple of these,

5800
03:35:17,909 --> 03:35:19,409
kind of in a square.

5801
03:35:19,409 --> 03:35:20,996
So he goes back and talks about this,

5802
03:35:20,996 --> 03:35:23,459
and an Englishman goes and studies them,

5803
03:35:23,459 --> 03:35:25,229
and he finds a ton of these sites.

5804
03:35:25,229 --> 03:35:28,528
And he finds some of them where there's 17 of these pairs.

5805
03:35:28,530 --> 03:35:29,699
And so he goes back

5806
03:35:29,700 --> 03:35:31,109
and he writes a whole book about

5807
03:35:31,110 --> 03:35:32,700
how clearly the Celtic peoples

5808
03:35:32,700 --> 03:35:33,839
who once lived in Britain

5809
03:35:33,840 --> 03:35:35,820
came originally from North Africa

5810
03:35:35,819 --> 03:35:37,198
'cause he's found this site.

5811
03:35:37,200 --> 03:35:39,119
And he reconstructs the religion,

5812
03:35:39,120 --> 03:35:41,939
where obviously they practice religious rituals here,

5813
03:35:41,940 --> 03:35:43,530
and they had rites of passage,

5814
03:35:43,530 --> 03:35:45,240
they squeeze between the things.

5815
03:35:45,239 --> 03:35:47,788
And the altar stones have this basin,

5816
03:35:47,790 --> 03:35:50,850
so they had blood sacrifice, and all this.

5817
03:35:50,850 --> 03:35:52,620
And it seemed reasonable.

5818
03:35:52,620 --> 03:35:54,307
And then, you know, you ask some locals,

5819
03:35:54,307 --> 03:35:55,859
"Well, what was that stuff out in the desert there?"

5820
03:35:55,860 --> 03:36:00,150
And they mean, "Oh, the old Roman olive oil factory?"

5821
03:36:00,149 --> 03:36:02,369
And those are the remains of an olive press.

5822
03:36:02,370 --> 03:36:03,270
And we're back to olives.

5823
03:36:03,270 --> 03:36:05,189
I keep dwelling on olives.

5824
03:36:05,190 --> 03:36:08,250
Olives don't grow in England or Germany.

5825
03:36:08,250 --> 03:36:11,160
- Yeah. - So this is cultural bias.

5826
03:36:11,159 --> 03:36:13,618
- If all you have is physical evidence,

5827
03:36:13,620 --> 03:36:15,269
you're gonna interpret that evidence

5828
03:36:15,270 --> 03:36:17,370
through your own cultural biases.

5829
03:36:17,370 --> 03:36:19,019
So if you're an Englishman

5830
03:36:19,020 --> 03:36:21,270
and you see big stone uprights like this,

5831
03:36:21,270 --> 03:36:22,980
you're gonna think Stonehenge.

5832
03:36:22,979 --> 03:36:24,539
If you're from the Mediterranean,

5833
03:36:24,540 --> 03:36:26,790
you're gonna think olive press.

5834
03:36:26,790 --> 03:36:31,620
So that's a salutatory example, I think,

5835
03:36:31,620 --> 03:36:35,430
of the dangers of interpreting physical evidence

5836
03:36:35,430 --> 03:36:37,079
when you don't have written evidence

5837
03:36:37,079 --> 03:36:38,893
to go along with it.

5838
03:36:38,894 --> 03:36:39,990
And, you know, think today.

5839
03:36:39,989 --> 03:36:43,709
Like if our civilization were to blow up in a nuclear war

5840
03:36:43,709 --> 03:36:46,258
and archeologists were to dig this up,

5841
03:36:46,260 --> 03:36:49,050
you know, how might they misinterpret things?

5842
03:36:49,049 --> 03:36:51,598
I mean, if they were to, you know,

5843
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:54,120
dig up a college dorm, like where I work,

5844
03:36:54,120 --> 03:36:56,459
and that's what you had for the civilization,

5845
03:36:56,459 --> 03:36:57,868
you'd probably go in the dorm rooms,

5846
03:36:57,870 --> 03:36:59,549
you'd find all these little rooms,

5847
03:36:59,549 --> 03:37:00,748
and maybe in every room,

5848
03:37:00,750 --> 03:37:03,839
you'd find this mysterious plastic disc.

5849
03:37:03,840 --> 03:37:05,550
And so everybody has these,

5850
03:37:05,549 --> 03:37:07,558
so it must be a cult object.

5851
03:37:07,559 --> 03:37:08,549
And it's round,

5852
03:37:08,549 --> 03:37:10,828
so obviously, they're sun worshipers.

5853
03:37:10,829 --> 03:37:12,869
And if you can decipher the inscription,

5854
03:37:12,870 --> 03:37:13,703
you'll see that, obviously,

5855
03:37:13,702 --> 03:37:16,733
they all worship the great sun god whammo.

5856
03:37:16,734 --> 03:37:19,140
- You know, it's like, what do you find in every dorm room?

5857
03:37:19,139 --> 03:37:20,159
A Frisbee. - Yeah.

5858
03:37:20,159 --> 03:37:23,699
- So that's the level of interpretation

5859
03:37:23,700 --> 03:37:25,050
you have to be aware of.

5860
03:37:25,049 --> 03:37:28,739
And there's examples where we've done exactly this.

5861
03:37:28,739 --> 03:37:30,748
- So we'll have to have intellectual humility

5862
03:37:30,750 --> 03:37:32,819
when we look back into the past.

5863
03:37:32,819 --> 03:37:36,089
But hopefully, if you have that

5864
03:37:36,090 --> 03:37:38,670
without coming up with really strong narratives,

5865
03:37:38,670 --> 03:37:41,670
if you look at a large variety of evidence,

5866
03:37:41,670 --> 03:37:44,190
you can start to construct a picture

5867
03:37:44,190 --> 03:37:46,140
that somewhat rhymes-

5868
03:37:46,139 --> 03:37:47,818
- Yes. - with the truth.

5869
03:37:47,819 --> 03:37:48,809
- Yes. I mean, that's,

5870
03:37:48,809 --> 03:37:50,669
as a professional historian, that's what you do.

5871
03:37:50,670 --> 03:37:54,239
You attempt to reconstruct an image of the past

5872
03:37:54,239 --> 03:37:58,439
that is faithful to the evidence you have

5873
03:37:58,440 --> 03:38:00,960
as filtered through what you can perceive

5874
03:38:00,959 --> 03:38:03,269
of both the biases and the problems

5875
03:38:03,270 --> 03:38:04,409
of the source material

5876
03:38:04,409 --> 03:38:06,449
and your own biases.

5877
03:38:06,450 --> 03:38:10,019
And it's a interpretation, it's a reconstruction,

5878
03:38:10,020 --> 03:38:11,370
but it's a lot like science

5879
03:38:11,370 --> 03:38:14,729
where you're in a process of constantly reevaluating it

5880
03:38:14,729 --> 03:38:16,499
and saying, "Okay, here's some new evidence.

5881
03:38:16,500 --> 03:38:18,030
How do I work this into the picture?

5882
03:38:18,030 --> 03:38:19,826
How do I, now, adjust it?"

5883
03:38:20,683 --> 03:38:21,719
And that's what's fun.

5884
03:38:21,719 --> 03:38:24,339
I mean, it's a mystery, you know.

5885
03:38:24,340 --> 03:38:25,830
You're being a detective

5886
03:38:25,829 --> 03:38:28,615
and trying to reconstruct and to understand a society.

5887
03:38:28,617 --> 03:38:30,300
And it's even more fun where it's,

5888
03:38:30,299 --> 03:38:32,789
yeah, you have to try to empathize.

5889
03:38:32,790 --> 03:38:34,380
Empathy is a great human thing.

5890
03:38:34,379 --> 03:38:37,528
To empathize with people who are not yourself.

5891
03:38:37,530 --> 03:38:39,449
And we should do this all the time

5892
03:38:39,450 --> 03:38:41,010
with just the people we encounter,

5893
03:38:41,010 --> 03:38:43,559
but this is what we're doing with ancient civilizations.

5894
03:38:43,559 --> 03:38:44,669
And as I talked about earlier,

5895
03:38:44,670 --> 03:38:47,100
sometimes you'll feel great sympathy there,

5896
03:38:47,100 --> 03:38:49,680
sometimes you'll feel incomprehension.

5897
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:51,660
But by being aware of both of those,

5898
03:38:51,659 --> 03:38:54,029
you can maybe begin to get some grasp,

5899
03:38:54,030 --> 03:38:55,320
however, tentative,

5900
03:38:55,319 --> 03:38:59,549
on the truth as you might perceive it.

5901
03:38:59,549 --> 03:39:01,558
- To ask a ridiculous question.

5902
03:39:01,559 --> 03:39:05,549
When our time, you and I, we, together,

5903
03:39:05,549 --> 03:39:07,079
become ancient history,

5904
03:39:07,079 --> 03:39:09,151
when historians, let's say,

5905
03:39:10,139 --> 03:39:11,999
2, 3, 4,000 years from now,

5906
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:15,609
look back at our time and, like you,

5907
03:39:15,610 --> 03:39:18,420
tried to look at the details

5908
03:39:18,420 --> 03:39:19,253
and reconstruct from that,

5909
03:39:19,253 --> 03:39:21,123
the big picture, what was going on,

5910
03:39:22,170 --> 03:39:23,549
what do you think they'll say?

5911
03:39:23,549 --> 03:39:25,169
- I would guess it'll be something

5912
03:39:25,170 --> 03:39:26,579
that's actually more of a commentary

5913
03:39:26,579 --> 03:39:28,319
on whatever's going on at that point

5914
03:39:28,319 --> 03:39:30,179
than on the reality of us,

5915
03:39:30,180 --> 03:39:31,950
because that's what we tend to do.

5916
03:39:31,950 --> 03:39:34,170
I'll tell you what I'd like to have them say.

5917
03:39:34,170 --> 03:39:36,480
Is to say, "In this civilization,

5918
03:39:36,479 --> 03:39:38,158
I can detect progress.

5919
03:39:38,159 --> 03:39:41,129
That they have advanced in some way,

5920
03:39:41,129 --> 03:39:43,018
whether kind of in moral terms

5921
03:39:43,020 --> 03:39:44,520
or in self-awareness,

5922
03:39:44,520 --> 03:39:46,193
or have learned from what's come before."

5923
03:39:46,192 --> 03:39:48,029
I mean, that's all you can try and do

5924
03:39:48,030 --> 03:39:50,400
is do a little bit better than whatever came before you,

5925
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:51,808
to look back at what happened,

5926
03:39:51,809 --> 03:39:53,432
and try to do something.

5927
03:39:54,930 --> 03:39:57,539
Livy, I mean, one of the great Roman historians,

5928
03:39:57,540 --> 03:39:59,040
the beginning of his work,

5929
03:39:59,040 --> 03:39:59,873
a history of Rome,

5930
03:39:59,872 --> 03:40:02,195
which is this massive thing, he says,

5931
03:40:02,197 --> 03:40:05,820
"The utility and the purpose of history is this:

5932
03:40:05,819 --> 03:40:08,729
It provides you an infinite variety

5933
03:40:08,729 --> 03:40:10,891
of experiences and models.

5934
03:40:12,180 --> 03:40:14,010
Noble things to imitate

5935
03:40:14,010 --> 03:40:16,469
and shameful things to avoid."

5936
03:40:16,469 --> 03:40:18,422
And I think he's right.

5937
03:40:19,770 --> 03:40:22,620
- And they would perhaps be better at highlighting

5938
03:40:22,620 --> 03:40:24,689
which shameful things we started avoiding

5939
03:40:24,690 --> 03:40:27,874
and which noble things we started imitating.

5940
03:40:27,873 --> 03:40:29,639
With the perspective of history,

5941
03:40:29,639 --> 03:40:31,082
they'll be able to identify.

5942
03:40:32,040 --> 03:40:34,923
Or maybe with the bias of the historians of the time.

5943
03:40:36,059 --> 03:40:37,829
Well, in that grand perspective,

5944
03:40:37,829 --> 03:40:39,958
what gives you hope about our future,

5945
03:40:39,959 --> 03:40:42,181
as a humanity, as a civilization?

5946
03:40:43,829 --> 03:40:45,002
- We have curiosity.

5947
03:40:46,680 --> 03:40:48,450
I think curiosity is a great thing.

5948
03:40:48,450 --> 03:40:50,490
That you wanna learn something new.

5949
03:40:50,489 --> 03:40:52,439
I think the human impulse to want to knew,

5950
03:40:52,440 --> 03:40:54,240
learn new stuff

5951
03:40:54,239 --> 03:40:56,908
is one of our best characteristics.

5952
03:40:56,909 --> 03:40:58,469
And at least up to this point,

5953
03:40:58,469 --> 03:40:59,549
what makes us special

5954
03:40:59,549 --> 03:41:01,109
is the ability to store up

5955
03:41:01,110 --> 03:41:02,850
an accumulation of knowledge

5956
03:41:02,850 --> 03:41:05,999
and to pass that knowledge on to the next generation.

5957
03:41:06,000 --> 03:41:07,360
I mean, that's really all we are.

5958
03:41:07,360 --> 03:41:09,569
We're the accumulation of the knowledge

5959
03:41:09,569 --> 03:41:10,446
of infinite generations

5960
03:41:10,447 --> 03:41:12,273
that have come before us.

5961
03:41:13,409 --> 03:41:15,179
And everything we do is based on that.

5962
03:41:15,180 --> 03:41:17,010
Otherwise, we'd all just be starting,

5963
03:41:17,010 --> 03:41:18,689
you know, at ground zero

5964
03:41:18,690 --> 03:41:20,609
kind of just from the beginning.

5965
03:41:20,610 --> 03:41:23,279
So our ability to store up knowledge and pass it on,

5966
03:41:23,280 --> 03:41:26,970
I think, is our special power as human beings.

5967
03:41:26,969 --> 03:41:30,061
And I think our curiosity is what keeps us going forward.

5968
03:41:31,020 --> 03:41:31,853
- I agree.

5969
03:41:31,852 --> 03:41:33,809
And for that, I thank you for being

5970
03:41:33,809 --> 03:41:35,989
one of the most wonderful examples of that,

5971
03:41:35,989 --> 03:41:37,888
of you, yourself, being a curious being

5972
03:41:37,889 --> 03:41:39,179
and emanating that throughout

5973
03:41:39,180 --> 03:41:41,789
and inspiring a lot of other people to be curious

5974
03:41:41,790 --> 03:41:44,640
by being out there in the world and teaching.

5975
03:41:44,639 --> 03:41:45,749
So thank you for that

5976
03:41:45,750 --> 03:41:47,070
and thank you for talking today.

5977
03:41:47,069 --> 03:41:48,208
- No, I enjoyed it. It's fun.

5978
03:41:48,209 --> 03:41:50,241
I obviously like talking about this stuff.

5979
03:41:51,600 --> 03:41:53,519
- Thanks for listening to this conversation

5980
03:41:53,520 --> 03:41:54,782

5984
03:42:01,860 --> 03:42:04,296
from Julius Caesar.

5985
03:42:04,297 --> 03:42:07,616
"I came, I saw, I conquered."

5986
03:42:08,850 --> 03:42:09,870
Thank you for listening

5987
03:42:09,870 --> 03:42:12,092
