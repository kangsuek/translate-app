1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,040
- Hi, it's me, Tim Dodd,
the Everyday Astronaut.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,530
Welcome back to Starbase Texas.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,870
This is of course, where
SpaceX is building their

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,220
Starship vehicles.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,720
This is part one of two parts,

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,280
and part one, we're gonna
take you around the factory,

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,010
see what's new, see the
ships, see the boosters,

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,410
see star factory from the
inside for the first time,

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,000
and just learn a lot along the way.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,310
So stay tuned for part two
where we'll take you out

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,890
to the launchpad and we'll
also follow up with Elon

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,660
after the launch and see how it went.

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,250
So without further ado,

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,990
let's go on another tour with Elon Musk.

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,805
Cool. So yeah, as we were
saying, I mean, obviously a,

16
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,840
a lot has changed in
the last couple years.

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,400
I mean, [It Has?] this all maybe in
theory, I don't know, I mean,

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,040
- Looks exactly the same.
It hasn't changed a bit,

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,130
- But once was tents is now
a permanent looking factory.

20
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,900
- Yeah. It used to be intense in tents,

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,350
and now it's in a building.

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,320
Yeah. Yeah. So we've got this, I think,

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,110
pretty good looking
rocket factory building

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,570
that we've almost completed.

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,010
Completed the exterior.

26
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,470
This is, this will enable us
to have serialized production

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,480
of the rocket, especially the ship,

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,880
which would ultimately be made, you know,

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,790
long term probably be making
a thousand a year of the ship.

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,105
So, thousand a year. Yeah.

31
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,890
Well, you know, gotta
build a city on Mars. Yeah.

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,660
- That's insane to think about.

33
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,700
- Yeah, I don't, I mean, we
may not build a thousand year

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,620
right here, but I think this is,

35
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,270
this is capable of a hundred a year.

36
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,510
Really? Sure. Wow. It's
only a ship every three days

37
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,685
- And that's nothing.

38
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:31,320
And Well, it is funny

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,610
'cause now, you know,
if you think about it,

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,220
even Falcon 9 these days,

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,035
you're producing a second
stage about every two days.

42
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:41,160
Yeah. And a few years ago,
that would've been impossible,

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,720
you know, no one would've imagined

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,845
Yeah. That they're building an upper

45
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:44,845
- Stage.

46
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,250
And this year we'll make almost
200 upper stages of falcon.

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,090
- That's - Unbelievable. And
next year, probably over 200.

48
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,166
- That's
- So, so

49
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:56,190
- That's a cadence of people
I don't think are, you know,

50
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,260
just even, you can't even
imagine, you can't even fathom

51
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,820
that kind of, you know Yeah.

52
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,350
Output like that. That's

53
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,350
- Just crazy.

54
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,630
Well, Falcon 9 is, is
actually a heavy lift vehicle.

55
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,120
So, you know, it's,

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,520
there's roughly 40,000 pounds orbit.

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,050
Yeah. So,

58
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,590
which is in normal rocket
language would be a heavy lift.

59
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,700
Yeah. So now Starship's gonna be able

60
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,570
to do a hundred tons
orbit with Starship 2

61
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,450
maybe a little more than that
with Starship 3 like

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,300
at the 9 meter diameter, essentially,

63
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,000
when the nine meter diameter
is sort of fully stretched out

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,860
to what ends up being from
120 meters total length

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,110
to probably 140 or something like that.

66
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,450
Then it's lot, this is
like a lot of optimizations

67
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,160
and improvement engine improvements,

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,730
heatshield mass improvements,
reducing the amount

69
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,225
of propellant needed for landing, kind

70
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:58,230
of basically do all the things
that we've somewhat done

71
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,860
with the Falcon 9.

72
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,860
And you get to a pretty efficient vehicle.

73
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,720
I think we'll be able to do over 200 tons

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,065
to a useful orbit with Starship.

75
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:09,685
That's insane. So, and
that's with full reusability,

76
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:11,410
that's a full reusability,
which isn't Yeah.

77
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,450
Insane. So that's twice the Saturn V

78
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,605
with full reusability and
full and rapid reusability.

79
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,490
So it's the booster

80
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,350
and the ship are coming back
to the launch site. Right.

81
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,625
- Should we, should we take a look at,

82
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,160
at what's going on in there?

83
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,160
So, so as far as, you know,
we're seeing all this,

84
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,180
you know, you're talking about
even version one maybe be

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,460
able to do less than a hundred,

86
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,710
but is is version one really even gonna,

87
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,450
I feel like version one in my head

88
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,450
- Is just a, yeah.

89
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,490
Version one is a, is just
to the, the point of, and,

90
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,860
and really kind of Starship,

91
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,910
we're version 1.6 / 7, I don't know.

92
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,340
Right? Yeah. It's like we're,
we're like many iterations

93
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,840
through on, on version one.

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,470
Yeah. So,

95
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,330
- And it's just like
a, it's just a canvas.

96
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,060
It's like a, it's a test
experiment still at this phase.

97
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,970
It's just a, yeah. I don't
think people, they see it

98
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,020
and they don't understand that like,

99
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,080
this is all still a
giant test at this stage.

100
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,000
- Yeah. One way to look at
technology is to look at it as

101
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,480
like, you, you're rendering an image in

102
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,340
successive levels of detail.

103
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,589
So the first layer of the image is very,

104
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,209
very blurry and things are out of place.

105
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,639
And then with the, with the next pass,

106
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,355
it gets a bit more defined

107
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,660
and things kind of shift into
place and you do another pass

108
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,170
and another pass, and
eventually it's something

109
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,290
that is refined and,
and, and actually works.

110
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,515
Right. But we're, we're in
uncharted territory with,

111
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:36,940
with Starship, so it's not like

112
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,970
nobody's ever made a fully
reusable orbital rocket.

113
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,805
Right. And that's, that's really the,

114
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:44,020
the critical breakthrough
necessary for life

115
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,460
to become multi-planetary.

116
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,100
For us to become a true
spacefaring civilization, we have

117
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,020
to achieve full and rapid reusability.

118
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,780
Yeah. So I call it rapidly
reusable, reliable rockets.

119
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,360
- Reusable, RR squared or
R-R-R-R. Yeah. Yeah. Pirate

120
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,290
- Space
- Pirates.

121
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,660
There we go.

122
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,920
- So,
- And it's, the thing is that people need

123
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,250
to remember is getting, achieving
orbits in solved, I mean,

124
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,160
you guys have been getting
to orbit for a long time.

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,425
Course. Reusing

126
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:14,925
- It, solve, getting, I mean,
getting to orbit at all was

127
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:16,420
solved in the, in the fifties, right.

128
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,170
I mean, for, you know, so, so I mean,

129
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,835
I really don't think there's
another point in point in

130
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:22,720
another, an expendable rocket.

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,240
Right. In my opinion. So,

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,010
or at least I think the
math clearly demonstrates

133
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,530
that it is, there is no point
in a, in an expandable rocket,

134
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,925
you have to achieve re reusability.

135
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,630
We, we have reusability in
cars, we have in airplanes,

136
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,190
we have it in bicycles.

137
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,380
Horses, yeah. It's bizarre

138
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,210
to not have reusability in any other form

139
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,710
of transport boats.

140
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,720
It would be insane to like chuck a

141
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,040
boat away after every trip.

142
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,570
Right. But this is how rockets have worked

143
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,925
for the vast majority of time.

144
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:51,910
In fact, SpaceX is still
the only rocket that that is

145
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,860
has any reusability with Falcon 9.

146
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,370
Right. So with Falcon 9
we, we bring the boosters back.

147
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,230
We, we, we fly them frequently.

148
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,330
We bring the fairings
back, we refly those.

149
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,980
It's only the upper stage
that is expended right now.

150
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,040
It doesn't, Falcon 9 does not
qualify as rapidly reusable.

151
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,475
Right. Because the, the most

152
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:15,050
of the time the booster is landing on a

153
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,400
ship in the ocean. Right.

154
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,170
- So it takes a few days
to get it back. Yeah.

155
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,180
Oh, that's speeding up like crazy.

156
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,570
I mean, the cadence out of
the cape is unbelievable.

157
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,765
- Yeah. We're trying to
squeeze every like, quarter

158
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,880
of a knot that we can out of
the, the drone ships. Yeah.

159
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,200
- So seems that way.

160
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,300
- Yeah. We're, I mean, we're
jacking up the power on the

161
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,750
ships streamlining, streamlining them,

162
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,790
increasing the power on
the, the tugging vessels

163
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,435
so we could just haul ass
as quickly as possible.

164
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:42,860
- Well, yeah. I think you just
had your fastest turnaround

165
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,150
just last week.

166
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,830
There was a, I mean,
it was something like,

167
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,670
I don't remember the time, but it was

168
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,840
something like two days or something.

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah. From, from catching back

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,880
and then out to catch again
was just you know, insane.

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,310
It used to take so much longer. And yeah.

172
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,480
Those are all those little things

173
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,190
that people just aren't
necessarily paying attention to

174
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,265
that are continually improving and Yeah.

175
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:04,340
- No, the SpaceX Falcon
team is doing an incredible job

176
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,040
of achieving fast turnaround

177
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,410
reusability given the architecture.

178
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,520
Yeah. Now that's, that's still,

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,370
however, a couple days
to get a booster back

180
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,700
and then, you know, at least
a few days to refurbish it

181
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,095
for flight is still not rapid by aircraft

182
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,810
or, you know, vehicle, you know, and,

183
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,500
and like, take cars, boats, planes.

184
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,730
Right. You know,

185
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,610
doing a trip every four
days is not, would not Right.

186
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,520
Cut it in a car. Right,
right. Or an aircraft. Right.

187
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,960
So with, with Starship,
the booster comes back

188
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,240
to the launch site is caught
by, caught by the arms,

189
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,030
or, you know, this would
be quite spectacular Yeah.

190
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,750
To see giant mechazilla arms catching
a rocket in midair. Yeah.

191
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,820
And, and then those,

192
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,610
those arms put it back on the launch site.

193
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,300
So you can have the booster
back on the launch mount in,

194
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,120
well it's gonna come, it's gonna come back

195
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
and land in like five or six minutes.

196
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
Right. So,

197
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,030
so then you can probably get
it back on the launch site in,

198
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,645
well if you really push it,
you probably put get back on

199
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:08,690
launch site in 10 minutes.

200
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,810
Right. Or even five minutes.

201
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,925
And then you can fill it up

202
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:18,050
in half an hour.

203
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,690
So you could, you could be
ready to go an hour later

204
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,280
from the booster standpoint,

205
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,870
and then if you've got ships lined up,

206
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,370
you can drop another ship on,

207
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,240
you know, fill it with propellant.

208
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,100
And in theory you could be
launching every couple hours.

209
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,750
Yeah.

210
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,860
- It's hard to imagine now,

211
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,590
but it was hard to imagine
where Falcon 9 is today.

212
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,539
You know, 10 years ago no one would've

213
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,039
imagined what Falcon 9 is doing now.

214
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,070
So I I think time will
tell that, you know,

215
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,605
you can just keep
chipping away at all those

216
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:48,620
little improvements.

217
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,510
And so do you think you'll actually

218
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,510
- Fly?

219
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,660
Yeah, Falcon 9 used to be
have reusability measured in,

220
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,210
in months, then weeks,
then days, and then for,

221
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,095
but for Falcon 9, the
architecture is limited to you.

222
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:03,570
You really can't compress it
down less than several days.

223
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,750
Right. When you take
the landing out to sea

224
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,395
and then the necessary
refurbishment of the booster Yeah.

225
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:12,780
That is required. So
with, with, with Starship,

226
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,720
we'll take it from days to hours.

227
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,515
Wow. Do you think? And yeah.

228
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,550
And then, yeah, so then
there's the, the ship has to go

229
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,710
around the earth and,
and depending upon what

230
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,990
or orbit it has, it's
gotta have a ground track

231
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,370
that comes back over the launch site.

232
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,600
Right. So that could take
several orbits so it, the,

233
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,090
the ship could take,
you know, several hours,

234
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,440
sometimes half a day or something

235
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,490
like that to come back to re-align.

236
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,630
Yeah. Yeah. So you'd, you'd want

237
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,340
to have a lot more ships than boosters.

238
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,470
Yeah. So if you're really
going for max launch rate,

239
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,645
you probably want roughly,
I dunno, five ships

240
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,500
to for every booster. For every booster.

241
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,160
- Yeah. And that's what you
guys are building a pretty

242
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,580
massive cadence here of, of
ships and boosters already.

243
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,170
Yeah. Now do you think,

244
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,645
- Well, I mean, yeah, it's,
it's pretty slow compared to

245
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:00,990
what it will be like very slow.

246
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,340
But we're also iterating the design.

247
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,300
So like each one is a little
different from some cases,

248
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,590
a lot different from the last one.

249
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,590
Yeah.

250
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,245
- Are any of these, what, are any

251
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:17,640
of these gonna be the V2 yet?

252
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,980
Are we starting to get close
to V2 hardware yet, or?

253
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Yeah,

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,330
- Just this, the, the stretch
version is basically V2.

255
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,605
Well, I guess it depends
on whether we call it V2

256
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,190
or don't call it V2.

257
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,900
The slightly stretched
version is V2 arguably.

258
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,830
That, so you can see, you know,

259
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,800
what we have here is a Starship
with, I've seen the heat,

260
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,140
the heat shield side and
the non heat shield side.

261
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,880
Yep. It's got the, what
we call the Pez dispenser

262
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,770
for tossing out the next
generation Starlink

263
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,540
satellites, the, the V3 satellites.

264
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,440
So those will be very wide
diameter like, like sort of,

265
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,635
I dunno, seven meter
diameter satellites.

266
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,600
Yeah. So, you know, 22 feet
or something like that. Right.

267
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,290
So,

268
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,940
- So are these actually gonna
be like, are we hoping to see

269
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,640
after, let's say this
test goes well tomorrow,

270
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,265
do you think the next one's
actually gonna go for orbit

271
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,810
and start deploying test, like testing out

272
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,895
as trying to deploy Starlink?

273
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,620
Or are we, where do you think
we're in, in that whole mix?

274
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,150
Like is that maybe a
few more down the road

275
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,460
to start actually deploying
payloads into orbit?

276
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,250
- We'll see how this mission goes.

277
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,640
I mean, this, this year is not,

278
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,565
not about delivering
satellites for Starship.

279
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,725
It's all about ironing out the, the,

280
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:53,800
the design question marks.

281
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,130
So the, I mean the major
things that remain to be solved

282
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,165
for Starship, the biggest, the, the,

283
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:06,015
the single biggest one is
what does it take to get

284
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,530
through the high heating of reentry?

285
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,630
So you can see the, the heat
shield that we have there.

286
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,260
We have some uh, well, let's say that

287
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,010
un unsolved questions Yeah.

288
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,900
On the heat shield. Yeah. A bunch

289
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,150
of which we don't even know
that they are questions.

290
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,130
And, and, and some we're aware of

291
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,110
because there've been
challenges in the past, like

292
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,130
with space shuttle Yeah.

293
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,630
The, the sort of the hinge
area and the hinge gap Yep.

294
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,860
And sealing that hinge gap

295
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,185
and not having hot gas just
go flowing super fast through,

296
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:44,530
through the, through the interface there.

297
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,160
Yeah. Through well at, at
where the flap hinge is. Yep.

298
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,120
'cause if, if, if you get hot
gas flowing through rapidly

299
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,470
that that'll cook anything Yeah.

300
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,350
Including the tiles. So, so you've,
you've got a,

301
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,950
you've got a hot gas
seal at the, the forward

302
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,260
and rear flap hinge.

303
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,365
And so, you know, one

304
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,580
of the key questions
is, does that seal work?

305
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,830
Right. We think it'll
work, but it may not work.

306
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,225
Then there are some, you
know, questions of like

307
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:17,800
how well do the tiles stay on.

308
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,465
Right. There's a, there's a
fundamental challenge here

309
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:25,990
where the tiles are ceramics,
they're very brittle,

310
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,690
they're like a, like a coffee cup Right.

311
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,740
Or a dinner plate. Yeah.

312
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,460
So you've got essentially a whole bunch

313
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,850
of dinner plates stuck to a steel surface.

314
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,590
The steel surface is
getting cryogenically cold

315
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,330
'cause of the propellants,
so it's shrinking.

316
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,380
Yeah. So on ascent, the,

317
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,330
the rocket is shrinking, it has shrunk.

318
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,150
Yep. So you got, you can't have the gaps

319
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,810
and the tiles be too tight

320
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,170
or they will just shatter
against each other.

321
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,610
Yeah. Yeah. The gap
will be too tight. Yep.

322
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,810
Then when it's coming in for
landing, the, the shuttle, the,

323
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,175
the, you no longer have the
cryogenic propellant in the main

324
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,930
tanks and the shuttles get,
the tiles get very hot.

325
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,290
Yep. So now they, they
want to expand. Yep.

326
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,250
So you've got a contracted inner surface

327
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,360
and expanding tiles.

328
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,370
Oh, geez. Yeah. Right.

329
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,560
So, and, and the thing is like, you can't,

330
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,970
you can't have a big tile gap

331
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,860
because then the plasma will get in there

332
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,290
and melt the primary structure behind it.

333
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,050
Exactly. Exactly. So like what's the,

334
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,640
what's the right tile gap?

335
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,280
And that's gonna vary depending
upon where you are on,

336
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,330
on the rocket on the ship.

337
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,395
Yeah. You know, so it's,
it's gonna be like some parts

338
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,250
of the ship have cryogenic
propellants, some don't.

339
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,250
Yeah. There's also the, how
well do the tiles attach

340
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,250
if we attach them and they,
and we accidentally break one.

341
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,890
But it's hard to see then
that that could be an issue.

342
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,580
Right. And we currently think we're,

343
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,450
we're probably not resilient
to failure of a, to loss

344
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,290
of a tile in the hot sections of the,

345
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,240
of the ship that are

346
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,740
the, the tank portion.

347
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,930
So that the, so if if

348
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,940
- The pressurized
- Areas Yeah.

349
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,080
The pressurized areas. Exactly.

350
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,340
So, and, and

351
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,145
so technically the nose
will be pressurized too.

352
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:24,470
So if the, if the
pressurized areas lose a tile

353
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,415
and then you melt that area,
that'll cause it to pop.

354
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:29,240
Right. Right. So the
ship will explode. Yeah.

355
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,270
So now people have asked like,

356
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,885
why are there some missing
tiles in the rear of the

357
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:35,885
- Ship?

358
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:36,860
Well, like right now, flight four,

359
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,770
you got I think three tiles
missing right now. Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,520
- So those are in the
rear of the, of the ship,

361
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,290
which is un pressurized region.

362
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah. Yeah. So that's an
un pressurized re region

363
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,760
where we think we can see, well you can,

364
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,280
you can have a melt through
of the un pressurized region

365
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,040
and it will not cause
failure of the, the vehicle.

366
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,150
Yeah. Yeah. Like you might have a

367
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,290
little hole there or something.

368
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,740
Right. But it's not gonna pop the vehicle.

369
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,390
- Right. So that's,
you're literally doing it

370
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,285
as like an A:B test almost
of like Yeah, we see

371
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:08,555
what happens if we're missing

372
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:09,555
- Tile.

373
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:11,575
Yeah. What happens if
you lose a tile? Huh?

374
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:16,100
Now we, we do have plans
for a secondary shield

375
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,350
beneath the tiles that is much

376
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,400
better than what we have right now.

377
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,660
So right now we, and some of the site

378
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,740
can't say the details of it

379
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,590
because it's like ITAR
control is sort of secret.

380
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,670
Right. But the current material we use,

381
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,730
we think is not resilient
to a tile failure.

382
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,490
We have a new design

383
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,160
that we think is resilient
to a tile failure.

384
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,990
- So behind the underlying structure.

385
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,210
- Yeah. And essentially it's got ablative.

386
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,760
So if you do, if you lose the
tile, you have to replace,

387
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,315
give your backup up the ablative.

388
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:51,200
Right, right, right. So you,
you, you'd have to, you'd,

389
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,940
you'd, you'd lose out on reusability

390
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,210
because of the lost tile
and the, and the ablative,

391
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,460
- But you have a, but
- At least it's intact. Yeah.

392
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,680
- And you'd recover it,
re refurbish it Yeah.

393
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,680
And get it back out on the
Yeah. On the fleet. That's

394
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
- Cool.

395
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,119
And especially for carrying
people, which ultimately we,

396
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,189
you know, expect Starship to carry it

397
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,810
maybe a hundred people at a time to Mars.

398
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,270
Right. And also to the moon. Yeah.

399
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,730
Then, you know, it's
gotta be super reliable.

400
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,990
It's gotta have no, no,

401
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,359
ideally no single point of failure. Right.

402
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,149
- So have you given up, I a long time ago,

403
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,650
you're talking about
transpirational cooling

404
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,540
or active regen and stuff.

405
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,120
Did that just kind of
didn't make the trade or

406
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:43,105
- I, - The mass trade that we
did, I think it's this point,

407
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,350
like it's four years ago
or something like that.

408
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,183
Yeah, maybe five.

409
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:53,610
It, it seemed like at that
time it would be at least twice

410
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,090
as heavy as a, a ceramic heat shield.

411
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,055
Now since then, the weight

412
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,610
of our ceramic heat shield has grown.

413
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,450
Yeah. And then when you factor
in the, the secondary shield,

414
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,430
that's additional mass.

415
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,690
Right. So, I don't know,
it may not be that big

416
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,130
of a difference between actively

417
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,090
cooling a heat shield and,
and having ceramic tiles.

418
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,580
- Have you seen what, what
Stoke Space out in Washington is

419
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,470
working on where they have a, it's

420
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,020
of course a aerospike's gonna
come, come outta my mouth.

421
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,920
'cause for some reason Aerospike

422
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,150
comes out every time
we talk about anything.

423
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,355
But it's a aerospike,

424
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:38,250
but the base plug is actually
the active region heat shield.

425
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,620
And so as it, and it's expander
cycle, so as it comes back

426
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,200
through the atmosphere, it's
actually, you know, heating,

427
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,580
they're using hydrogen to, to
actively regenerate, you know,

428
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,890
and cool the heat shield and
just gets dumped out the,

429
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,685
the nozzles basically as
it's, you know, as it's going.

430
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,605
And that actually also gets some

431
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,015
of the gaskets vented
out through the middle.

432
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,860
So you also have like a, a
boundary layer there too of,

433
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,320
of gaseous helium or hydrogen
in the, in the front.

434
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,520
And it's being actively regen.

435
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,550
I think it's, it's a
really cool, cool concept

436
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,500
and I was really impressed.

437
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,170
It's a, it's, it made me
just think about like regen,

438
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,550
you know, active regen in a different way.

439
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,830
And I thought that was pretty
neat. But I know you guys had

440
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,068
talked about the transpirational
cooling years ago, so it's,

441
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,070
I didn't know if Yeah,

442
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,400
- I think it's probably correct that that,

443
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,350
that a ceramic heat shield is gonna do

444
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,150
better than transpiration.

445
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,910
There's also the question of
like, if, if once if you go

446
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,700
to Mars and you're coming in
and, and hot and you're come

447
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,250
or you and you're coming back
to earth, you're coming in.

448
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,290
If you come back from, from Mars to earth,

449
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,555
you're coming in very hot.

450
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:41,070
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's not clear

451
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,710
where the transpiration
cooling could succeed

452
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,330
there. It came up there. Yeah.

453
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,770
- Your here's my wacky dumb
idea of the day is on the inside

454
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,960
of the tank, if you had
like a thermal camera,

455
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,570
you have like a fire hose
with cryogenic coolant,

456
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,790
just spray if there's a
hot a burn through Sure.

457
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,440
Spray it down from the inside.

458
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,650
I don't know, I'll just,
I'll always be happy

459
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,870
to throw out the dumb the dumb ideas.

460
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,880
Especially when you have
header tanks there, you know,

461
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,910
that are filled with, with
the cryo all pressurized ready

462
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,060
to go, you know, all
it's gonna take is one,

463
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,680
one heat shield tile missing potentially

464
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,075
and could have a Yeah.

465
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:20,075
A bad day. You know,

466
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,640
- There's a lot of ways
to solve the problem.

467
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,030
Yeah. So the, I mean,

468
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,300
what matters is that it is solved.

469
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,650
Yeah. Even though like, yeah, there are,

470
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,450
there are many ways to
achieve pool reusability.

471
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,600
What matters is that, is it is achieved.

472
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,090
- Yeah. A hundred
- Percent. And then bet

473
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,550
once you're in the sort of over
the hump of full reusability

474
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,030
where the one system is slightly
better than the other is a

475
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,470
secondary concern, right?

476
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,900
- Yeah. It's tomato, tomato
at that point. Yeah. Yeah.

477
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,840
Should we keep moving along here? Yeah.

478
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,650
So when, with flight three,
when it, when it broke up,

479
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,750
that was mostly just because obviously it

480
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,583
couldn't maintain

481
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,045
orientation, so it didn't
even have a chance of

482
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:11,045
- Having the heatshield.

483
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh yeah. You would've
noticed that the engines,

484
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,310
there was a lot of like fire
coming from the engines area.

485
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,870
Just not, you know, that's not
good. Yeah, yeah. On reentry.

486
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,950
- Right. Definitely not when the

487
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,950
- Engines aren't on.

488
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,920
- Yeah. - So this is, you
can see we're just finishing,

489
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,525
we we're try to get the
shell completed as quickly

490
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,290
as possible, but we
still have a lot of work

491
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,150
to do on the interior of the factory.

492
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,270
But this will dramatically improve the

493
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,650
production of the rocket Yeah.

494
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,540
As being able to move from
one station to another,

495
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,540
which is a linear adjacent flow.

496
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,910
- Hmm. I don't, I mean, I assume,

497
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,050
I don't really know what that means, but,

498
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,310
- Well, I mean, the, the
thing that really matters for,

499
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,050
you know, people talk about
the moving production line

500
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,600
of sort of Henry Ford and the automobiles.

501
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,540
What actually matters is
linear adjacent flow as opposed

502
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,830
to a production line that moves

503
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,850
- Hmm.

504
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,220
So, so

505
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,780
- The, so it's, it's simple.

506
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,390
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah. Like one thing leads one,

507
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,010
one step leads to another Yeah.

508
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,410
And it just, and things move
along in a cadence. Okay.

509
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,210
Yeah. Yep.

510
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,590
- And you don't have to have the physical,

511
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,910
- It doesn't matter whether
there's a convey belt

512
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,235
or not got, it's the secondary concern.

513
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,430
- That's the second. Yeah. Got
- It. Doesn't matter.

514
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,420
It just matters that, that,
that there's a, there's a tempo.

515
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,730
Yeah. So every station
has roughly the same

516
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,780
amount of work time.

517
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,410
Right. And things move from
one station to the next station

518
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,480
and the specialization
of labor at each station.

519
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,720
Yes. Okay. So these are the
principles that actually matter.

520
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,553
- And that's what you guys kind of

521
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:39,790
solved by doing the tents first.

522
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,580
'cause you could just
willy-nilly rearrange things, see

523
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,020
how things were actually falling, see

524
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,580
what order things were going in. But

525
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,840
- The tents were very inefficient

526
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,610
once you know what you wanna build. Yes.

527
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,405
- Yep. Yeah. So it was
the, your five step thing

528
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:54,220
of don't get too far along
in the automation before you

529
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
- Yeah.

530
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,053
You don't know what
you're gonna build. Yep.

531
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,210
Like it's simple to convey
just how, how much, like,

532
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,160
you know, this, this is, you
don't, we don't even know

533
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,390
what the rocket would look like.

534
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,010
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So,

535
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,410
- And in, in some senses you still

536
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,390
don't necessarily know it's still changing

537
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,390
- At this point.

538
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,240
We at this point we're confident of

539
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,210
that this architecture
will is is at least one

540
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,710
of the solutions.

541
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,440
Yeah. Let's not say there
couldn't be other solutions like

542
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,400
the one you talked about,
but that this will work.

543
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,460
Yeah. It's just a question
of ironing out the bugs

544
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,810
and improving the performance
of everything from the engines

545
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,190
to the avionics

546
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,080
to the primary structure,
the heat shield, everything.

547
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,120
Yeah. And

548
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,810
that's, but it will work.

549
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,130
Yeah. I think I was mentioning,

550
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,520
or I was beginning to say that the, the,

551
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,940
so the most important, the
toughest remaining problem is a,

552
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,330
a reusable orbital heat shield.

553
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,670
So there's never,

554
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,160
nobody's ever made it
reusable orbital heat shield.

555
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,140
So the space shuttle is the closest. Yeah.

556
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,270
But that took I think
something like nine months

557
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,520
and thousands of people to refurbish.

558
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,380
Right. So it's difficult to call when can,

559
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,380
can I call something that
requires so much work to refurbish

560
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,700
as truly re reusable?

561
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,930
Yeah. Certainly not rapid. Yeah.

562
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,060
So for the first time
ever, there needs to be a,

563
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,650
a rapidly reusable orbital heat

564
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,350
shield, which no one has ever done.

565
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,880
So it's a hard problem. Right.

566
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,160
So that's why I'd say
that's, that's the number one

567
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,665
biggest remaining problem.

568
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:32,300
And the, the, the goal of this flight,

569
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,225
and really the flights the, for
the rest of this year is get

570
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,935
through the high heating.

571
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,000
So the, the heat shield survives. Yep.

572
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,065
And, and then, and, and the,
the ship is still operational

573
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:50,270
and is able to steer
to a specific location

574
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,800
and do a landing burn Yep.

575
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,880
In the ocean. Yes.

576
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,040
And, and then the, the booster,
we wanted to be able to,

577
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,750
for this flight to come back

578
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,820
and do a landing boom
at a specific location.

579
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,080
Yep. So do we know, how

580
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,280
- Far out is that gonna be? Do you

581
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
- Know?

582
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,790
It's pretty far out. I mean, we're, but,

583
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,200
but I think we're pretty close to that.

584
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,740
If we don't solve it on this flight,

585
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,440
I think we'll solve it in, in
the next two or three flights.

586
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,850
So just having this, the,
the, the, the booster,

587
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,540
do the hot staging come back,
you know, do a boost back

588
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,810
steer, steer correctly and
to a precise location Yeah.

589
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,751
And do a landing burn and then, and, and,

590
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:35,570
and essentially do a
simulated tower catch. So it's

591
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,950
- Like, so will the tower actually

592
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,950
- No.

593
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,790
It's just a Okay. It, it, the
rocket will think it's Right.

594
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,410
Not trying to get caught
by the tower. Right.

595
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,490
- At least the, I thought it
would be kind of cool if the

596
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,030
tower mimicked it, you
know, out here to make sure.

597
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,160
Because I even wonder like

598
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,780
how do we know the tower's gonna be okay?

599
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,910
You know, like after a launch like that

600
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,930
to be able to Well we,

601
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,580
- We can, we, we operate the tower

602
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,950
after the launch so we can
tell if there's any damage.

603
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,500
Yeah. But yeah, if, if,

604
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,565
if this launch goes
perfectly we'll be able to,

605
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:08,270
we'll we'll have the, the,
the booster do a boost back

606
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,980
and a, a controlled aero
con, aero controlled descent

607
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,545
to a specific location.

608
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:17,570
Yes. Initiate landing, burn

609
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,945
and be caught by an imaginary tower.

610
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:24,710
Yep. Yep. And then the ship,
if things go perfectly,

611
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,350
which probably won't, it'll
get through high heating,

612
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,500
it will still be fully operational.

613
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,710
It will control itself
to a specific location

614
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,540
and in the ocean, and then
initiate a landing burn

615
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,560
and also pretend as to
getting caught by tower.

616
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,310
Wow. Now I think it, it,

617
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,970
I think we've got maybe a 50 50 chance

618
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,480
of the heat shield working. I mean

619
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,010
- That's decent.

620
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,565
- Yeah. Yeah. Like it's a
high, a high uncertainty,

621
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:00,180
but like roughly 50 50.

622
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,530
But if not on this flight,
it then in the next two

623
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,710
or three flights, I, I think
we'll solve that. Yeah.

624
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,990
- Well, and you guys, let's,
let's kind of head over here.

625
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,930
You guys did make a
decent amount of changes

626
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,500
to hopefully ensure
reentries better this time.

627
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,840
Like you added some new roll thrusters.

628
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,670
- Oh
- Yeah, yeah. And a few things like that.

629
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,140
- Well, yeah.

630
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,590
- What, what happened there
that the roll thrusters got,

631
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,420
because they got clogged it sounds like.

632
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,225
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Don't
tell me that was the,

633
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:33,420
the old conversation we had

634
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,850
of hot gas thrusters and all that stuff.

635
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,820
Or was it, but still, I,
I'm still confused. 'cause

636
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,210
- They, they, they got ice,
ice, ice in the, in the valves.

637
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,440
- Okay. In the valves.

638
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,070
Not necessarily, or in the,
somewhere along the stream.

639
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,230
- They, they got clogged by
ice. We're not sure exactly how.

640
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,830
Yeah. But, but if water,
ice, we'll get into the, the,

641
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,070
the oxygen side, there's a small amount.

642
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,800
So since we're the location

643
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,910
that we're tapping off the
engine is not, is not pure O2,

644
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,820
it's got a little bit of a water ice.

645
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,500
- Why - Is that? It's, it's,
it's, it's ox rich gas.

646
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,290
- It is ox. So is it
coming off the actual Yeah.

647
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,470
Like exhaust or the
turbine side. Yeah. Really?

648
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,675
Yeah. So wouldn't it have,

649
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:26,820
- Wouldn't even have a little
bit of it's ox rich gas,

650
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,310
but it's Yeah, no, it's,
it's got burnt fuel.

651
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,270
- Yes. Wouldn't it have a little
bit of CO2 in it too then?

652
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,095
And can that turn into an ice?

653
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,320
Do you freeze CO2 with

654
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,760
that temperature? 'cause I think, yeah,

655
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,750
- Well anyway, it's, it's,
it's, it's, it's got stuff

656
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,320
that can turn solid at cryogenic
temperatures, the thing

657
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,490
that's relevant, right.

658
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,490
So

659
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
- Yeah.

660
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,480
Ice, whether it be water, ice or Yeah.

661
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,460
Or CO2 ice or whatever. Ice, ice.

662
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,130
- Yeah. And it's solid stuff
that does that. Blocks,

663
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,130
- Blocks things.

664
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,790
- Blocks things. So we do,

665
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,275
we we we've improved the sort of

666
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:05,265
ice strainers or the ice catchers.

667
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:07,050
Yeah. We improve the valves.

668
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,530
And something I think we'll
do in the future is move to,

669
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,050
for critical valves,
serious parallel valves.

670
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:18,450
So any one valve failure does
not, no matter what happens,

671
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,675
does not take out the ability of the ship

672
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,440
to orient itself correctly.

673
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,780
- So are you avoiding doing like a more

674
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,480
of a traditional heat
exchanger, like around raptor?

675
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,910
You know, like, like I think
Merlin probably does that,

676
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,350
where it has a heat exchangers

677
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,030
to heat up to be able to ride stuff.

678
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,390
The helium. Yeah. I'm just curious.

679
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,630
I've never heard of an engine
using like already combusted

680
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,350
to be able to be the
ullage gas, you know, off

681
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,430
of the, off the preburner.

682
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,090
That's pretty unusual I
think at least, I don't know.

683
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,510
- Yeah. Well we're,

684
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,460
our rocket is autogenously pressurized.

685
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,580
Yeah. So we're pressurizing the
fuel side with gaseous fuel.

686
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,430
Yep. And the oxide with
mostly gaseous oxygen. Yep.

687
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,460
And yeah.

688
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,070
Now in the case of
autogenously pressurized,

689
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,210
we have to create the gas.

690
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,790
We're not merely warming up a gas.

691
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,440
We have to produce the gas.

692
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,810
- Oh, interesting. Is that how
the shuttle did it too then?

693
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,960
'cause the shuttle ran
on the RS-25's had

694
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,225
autogenous pressurization on

695
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:16,660
- The, on the hydrogen side.

696
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,070
Yeah. I think that it, I,

697
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,840
- Well I guess I don't
know if it's on both.

698
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,400
- Was it on both? I
don't know. I don't know.

699
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,560
I think it was at least
on, on the hydrogen side.

700
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,970
So maybe on both.

701
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,600
But when, when you, when you
have autogenous pressurization,

702
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,620
you've gotta produce the gas.

703
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,180
You're not just heat it up. Okay.

704
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,050
So there's a lot more mass
you better come up with Yeah.

705
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,580
- Literally.
- Yeah.

706
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,720
It actually affects our max power on the,

707
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,280
especially on the fuel side.

708
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,430
So the fuel pump has to
work well, both pumps have

709
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,905
to work harder, but the fuel pump

710
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:55,090
especially is a limiting factor.

711
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,420
Like if we turned off autogenous
pressurization on the fuel

712
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,770
side, we'd actually be able to get

713
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,660
more power out of the fuel pump.

714
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,550
- Oh yeah. 'cause you're
having to drive all that.

715
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,370
- Yeah. You've gotta, you've
gotta gas that you're, you're,

716
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,170
you're, you're bleeding mass flow right.

717
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,940
From the, you know, from the
engine. Yeah, from the engine.

718
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,800
Yeah. You're,

719
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,190
and yeah, I mean there's,
there's quite a lot of work in,

720
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,560
in taking a cryogenic liquid

721
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,510
and heating it up to be a hot gas.

722
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,750
Right. So you're a phase
transition and, and,

723
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,130
and that big temperature delta.

724
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,590
Yeah. So it's actually a, a lot of work

725
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,990
to produce the hot gas
from a cryogenic liquid.

726
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,900
- That's crazy. So is that
what also, can we, can we kind

727
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,820
of step in here and see
the, all the boosters?

728
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,500
This is crazy.

729
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,975
Is that what also was the blockage

730
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:42,310
of the LOx tank on the booster too then?

731
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,570
Similar ice buildup, blockage?
Or was it on flight three?

732
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,610
The Raptors were shutting
down during boost.

733
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,820
Backburn had an ice buildup.
Is it a similar thing to that?

734
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,900
- Sorry, it's hard to hear you.

735
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,720
- Yeah. Is that what
caused the, the booster

736
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,080
to shut down on flight three
with the ice ice buildup?

737
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,250
Was it a similar type of thing?

738
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,625
Like an autogenous pressurization issue

739
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,870
that clogged a few of the engines?

740
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,830
- Yeah. We didn't have enough
pressure to start the engines.

741
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,175
- Okay. - So we're low low
pressure start the, the, the,

742
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:15,820
the full answer is quite complicated.

743
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,540
But because arguably we
could have started with

744
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,130
with lower pressure or we, we didn't need

745
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,990
to start all the engines anyways.

746
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,630
This, this time we expect
to have a lot more pressure

747
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,410
and we are able to start at lower pressure

748
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,080
and we don't need to have
all the engines fire.

749
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,210
Okay, cool. You know, hopefully. Yeah. So,

750
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,750
- Geez, this is crazy.

751
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,340
Wow. The scale is just almost impossible

752
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,550
to to imagine. And

753
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,810
- Yeah, three, three boosters.

754
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,090
- Wow. That's just insane.

755
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,870
This looks so cool.

756
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,710
- Dang.
- Lot of engines.

757
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,040
- Yeah. It's an insane amount of engines.

758
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,590
I mean, right here we're
looking at what, 99 Yeah.

759
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,105
Engines for these three vehicles.
Nine ounces. Nine nines.

760
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:17,330
- Nine, nine Raptors on a wall.

761
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,790
- 99 engines and a ship ain't one. Yeah.

762
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,530
That's absolutely insane.

763
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,030
The scale of these things, it's just hard

764
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,230
to, hard to fathom.

765
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,870
Wow. So are you guys
are trying to move down

766
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,130
to three grid fins, is that right?

767
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,660
From the, from the four Is that

768
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,330
- It's sort of high priority.

769
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,820
It's a, it's a mass
optimization to move you,

770
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,050
you definitely only need three.

771
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,500
Yeah. And I think technically
you could do it with two

772
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,040
if you're willing to oscillate

773
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
- Yeah.

774
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,270
Like turn for yard, then road
roll again for pitch and Yeah.

775
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,560
- That's definitely, you
know, you're asking for a bit

776
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,810
of trouble if you just have two grid fins.

777
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,110
Right. But it is
technically possible. Right.

778
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,840
The three three for sure.

779
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,779
But that's, that's like
a, that's a fairly minor

780
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,920
optimization, right.

781
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,510
- With the, the, the cowbell
diverter things, you know, the,

782
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,150
the ullage gas thrusters or whatever.

783
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,500
I need to clear something up for myself

784
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,150
because I'm getting confused.

785
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,639
So cold gas thruster, we'd say like,

786
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,469
would be like a nitrogen thruster

787
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,089
where it's just literally compressed

788
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,824
nitrogen goes out of an nozzle.

789
00:34:30,824 --> 00:34:32,539
- Cold gas is room temperature gas usually

790
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,679
- Is room temperature.

791
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,109
And then are we, would we consider

792
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,165
that almost like a warm gas

793
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:38,360
- Thruster? Yeah. Warm gas thruster.

794
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,190
- And then like a hot gas
would be where it's a reaction.

795
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,860
Probably like a bi a bi
propellant thruster still

796
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,940
- For both the booster and the ship.

797
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,520
You don't really need much control.

798
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,430
The attitude control needed is, is small.

799
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,270
So you just can't have a leaky valve

800
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,590
or a stuck valve [or a stuck Valve].

801
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,590
- Yeah. That seems, I I,
this is like the third time we've

802
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,500
- Falcon 9s, is all cold gas.

803
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,780
- What is
- Falcon 9s all cold gas.

804
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,550
And we've done, I think six starts.

805
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,870
So it's, it's, it's cold gas that has been

806
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,660
maintaining propellant settling

807
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,070
and attitude control for,
you know, 12 hours. Right?

808
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
- Yeah. So, and you
have a lot of it on tap.

809
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,340
So that's, I don't know why

810
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,175
that's still a hard one for me to fathom.

811
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,580
Even though we've talked,
this is the third time

812
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,710
- Now its got a lot of hot
gas. Yeah. Or warm gas,

813
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,710
- Especially when it's empty.

814
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,405
It's, it's all warm, warm gas. Yes.

815
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:33,560
- The, the delta delta
V needed is tiny. Yeah.

816
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,740
So it's very tiny
thrusters are needed. Ah.

817
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,910
So yeah.

818
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,080
- So how much do you feel like

819
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,110
after you fly, how much is
it like, oh God, we have

820
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,610
to change all of these?

821
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,340
Like is it, is it literally
you find something on one

822
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,920
and then you're literally
like in immediately having

823
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,305
to make changes on all these things?

824
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,550
Like everything that's
in production? Yeah.

825
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,660
- You're just learning lessons.
There's, there's hundreds

826
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,920
learning changes that actually take place.

827
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,440
Not a few, yeah. Hundreds.

828
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,750
If you go to a detail level,

829
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,205
there might be thousands
of changes that happen,

830
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,380
- Especially when you get
software involved. I'm sure it's

831
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,380
- Software for sure.

832
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,605
I'm just taking a, talking
hard. It's hardware.

833
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:14,520
If you're just, look, the
hardware changes across the ship

834
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,630
and the, the booster

835
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,120
and the engines, it's thousands

836
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,500
of changes between each flight.

837
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,020
But many of them are very small.

838
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,570
But a very small change
could be a big deal.

839
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,120
- Imagine how long it'd take a
traditional aerospace company

840
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,130
that had a, a rocket they're working on

841
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,840
to make a thousand changes between flights

842
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,130
and then fly it two months later.

843
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,220
I mean that's, that's
what we're doing here.

844
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,830
This is, you're barely over
two months from the last flight

845
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,740
and the vehicle's had
over a thousand changes

846
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
- Easily.

847
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,713
Over a thousand, several thousand

848
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:47,220
probably. So that's insane.

849
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,990
- Like - You said, a bunch
of 'em, a little changes,

850
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,690
but say like, is it
different in a way that could

851
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,080
have a, an effect on the rocket?

852
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah. Yeah. That's
probably several thousand.

853
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,160
- And do you feel like for now,
are you generally like kind

854
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,740
of overbuilding them to just
try to get through the point

855
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,830
of being able to prove the heat
shields prove all the stuff

856
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,420
and then eventually you're work on

857
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
- Mass?

858
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,253
Yeah. We're, we're trying
to answer the questions

859
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:08,513
that I mentioned.

860
00:37:08,513 --> 00:37:11,340
The biggest question being
can, what does it take

861
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,420
to get through max heating?

862
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,400
Yep. With a reusable heat
shield, then being able

863
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,460
to have the booster come back

864
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,950
and be caught by the, the tower Yep.

865
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,780
And have the, the ship also come

866
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,070
back and be caught by the tower.

867
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,200
Yeah. So those are the three very big

868
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,580
things that need to happen.

869
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,860
- And that's in your mind
when you're launching these,

870
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,150
including like flight 1, 2, 3,

871
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,565
you're, those are the questions.

872
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,530
Like those flights are just
to answer bonus questions

873
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,850
- Full reusability.

874
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,280
- See I think people just
don't understand that that's,

875
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,500
you're not looking at
trying to get out there and,

876
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,880
and launch a satellite tomorrow.

877
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,805
You're trying to answer the

878
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:47,805
- Questions.

879
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:48,990
The payload, the payload for
all the flights this year is

880
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,600
data is data just to learn things.

881
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,120
So it's, it's design refinement
to understand what actually,

882
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,770
what, what works, what doesn't work.

883
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,040
Yeah. You know, some things
sometimes work Right.

884
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,260
Which can throw you off
'cause it worked once,

885
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,300
but doesn't work again
because of the combination

886
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,530
of factors isn't the same.

887
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,940
Yep. So, so you want to have, so

888
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,120
the first things you'll find
are like fundamental errors

889
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,770
of design where success was not

890
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,940
one of the possible outcomes.

891
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,110
Yep. Then in some cases it's
kinda like Russian roulette

892
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,805
success is sometimes possible.

893
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:25,380
Possible, right? Yeah. But once in a while

894
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,825
you, you blow yourself up.

895
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:30,985
Yeah. Yeah. So that's gonna
require a lot of flights to,

896
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:33,270
to figure out those like
the, the one in 10 failure,

897
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,830
the one in a hundred
failure, that kind of thing.

898
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,210
Yeah. There'll be a whole
bunch of things like that.

899
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,275
- Well, kind of even like the
SN stuff when 8 was darn

900
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:43,000
close to landing 9 was
almost a reversion feeling.

901
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,920
10 was better, 11 was worse.

902
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,290
Like there's a little bit of a
ping pong as things were kind

903
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,340
of being tried and tested.

904
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,230
And you're still kind of in that phase.

905
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,615
Even even at this scale.

906
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:54,700
I just don't think people
are used to that. You know?

907
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,330
- Yeah. I mean a lot, a lot of
those like early tests were,

908
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,540
were also just about us
learning how to work with

909
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,590
stainless steel Right.

910
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,790
As the primary, primary
structural element. Yeah.

911
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,600
And working with liquid methane. Right.

912
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,560
And with a, a full flow stage
combustion engine. Right.

913
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,880
As the, as the engine. Yeah.

914
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,590
So a lot of what people saw
was that the, the, the flight,

915
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,090
you know, did it land or not land,

916
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,460
but we're just trying to
figure out how do we work

917
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,605
with steel Right.

918
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:29,740
And how do we work with a
methane as a fuel and a new

919
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,940
- Engine architecture
- And a

920
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,320
totally new engine architecture

921
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,090
- And new flaps. Like
things that are just Yeah.

922
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,860
- Do the flaps
- New and novel.

923
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,950
- Yeah. You have to actuate the flaps.

924
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,350
You need, you need very powerful
actuators for the flaps.

925
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,555
Yeah. 'cause there are a
lot of force. It's like an

926
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:43,720
airplane moving its wings.

927
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,700
- Right, right. So

928
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,980
- These are very powerful
actuators that are needed.

929
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,120
- Yeah, absolutely.

930
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,350
- So, you know,

931
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,360
and all of the, the the,
like the, the engine

932
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,830
to vehicle interactions
are very complicated.

933
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,120
Yeah. So, but you,

934
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,040
you don't really see those
on the test stand when you,

935
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,780
when you're firing the
engines on the test stand,

936
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,330
you don't get the engine
to vehicle interactions.

937
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,715
And then you've got different Right.

938
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,420
Engines vehicle interactions in

939
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,800
flight than you do on the ground.

940
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,900
- Yeah. Oh a hundred.
Especially when you're changing

941
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,250
orientation of a vehicle.

942
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,940
Yeah. And different G-Force
and zero G mean all the things

943
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,030
- There, there's no test
stand that can test a,

944
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,450
a rocket at 17,000 miles
an hour doing six Gs Right.

945
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,030
In, you know, every
different orientation. Right.

946
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,860
Exactly. It's not, it's not possible. Yep.

947
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,270
- So you have to fly it.

948
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,700
- Yeah. You, you do as much
as you can on the ground,

949
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,890
then you gotta fly it, try

950
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,780
to figure things out in simulation.

951
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,135
But a lot of things are not gonna

952
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:40,150
be included in the simulation.

953
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,040
So it'll work in some, but not in reality.

954
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,690
- Exactly. It's crazy.
Shall we keep moving?

955
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,710
- Yeah,
- Sure.

956
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:18,165
- Are you
- I

957
00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:22,600
over here that way?

958
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,130
Yes sir. We are just about

959
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,410
to de-rig from the crane and then

960
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:30,775
- Right on.

961
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:32,988
- Geez.

962
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,510
- Wow.
- Are we good down there? Yep.

963
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,120
- As you can see, the Raptor is a

964
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,260
lot cleaner than it used to be.

965
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,020
It looks like this less stuff, but Yeah.

966
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,490
- That
- Already.

967
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,070
- Yeah.
- But these, these are still not like the,

968
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,745
we're not to V3 here yet, right? No,

969
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:54,980
- No.

970
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,090
- Is the V3 the same thing

971
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,520
as like the Leet (733T) engine?
Is that, are those

972
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,420
- Sort of the LEET engine
was, I think we will do

973
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,950
that at some point, but that's like a,

974
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,470
that's really a total tear up.

975
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,790
Really. Yeah. Yeah.

976
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,000
It looks like the LEET engine,
but it's way more expensive

977
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,200
because it still has
printed parts, for example.

978
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,550
So, but the, yeah,

979
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,300
the next gen Raptor engine
needs no heat shield.

980
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,470
- Right.
- So,

981
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,760
- And because it's exposed,
it has to have cooling.

982
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,890
So there's integral
cooling circuits throughout

983
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,240
the, all the parts.

984
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,290
So it looks very simple on the

985
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,340
outside, but it's complicated on the

986
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
- Inside.

987
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,173
Like even all throughout the,

988
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:38,150
like the preburner and the Yeah.

989
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,770
Gas manifolds and everything. It's all,

990
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,110
- All that stuff you see
stuck on the side disappears.

991
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,500
- Wow.
- And that's actually, you like

992
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,570
that's being worked on now
already. That's already,

993
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,570
- Yeah.

994
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,355
We have a design, we have a
design that that, that works.

995
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:54,350
It, it, it, it looks like
the engine isn't complete.

996
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,840
- Well yeah, you had that,
that that render on the,

997
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,555
that presentation it just
looked like literally

998
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,660
like a, it looks

999
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,970
- Like it's missing
- Parts mock up. Yeah. Yeah.

1000
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,610
- But it's actually just
the, the secondary circuits

1001
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:09,610
and integral cooling are
part of each part, so Wow.

1002
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,090
So if you have a
secondary cooling circuit,

1003
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,800
you run the secondary cooling circuit or,

1004
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,160
or secondary flow circuit
through the various parts.

1005
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,540
Right. And we also eliminate
a whole bunch of bolted

1006
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,770
and welded joints.

1007
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,950
So especially the bolted

1008
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,140
joints, you really wanna
get rid of those. Yeah,

1009
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
- Yeah.

1010
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,870
- You know,
- Bolts and flanges

1011
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,090
and seals of hell,
especially if they're hot.

1012
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,640
So Yeah. The, the next gen Raptor engine

1013
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,030
is actually a little difficult to service

1014
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,430
because there are parts that are,

1015
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,605
that don't have a flange anymore,

1016
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:48,800
it's just welded shut. Right,

1017
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
- Right, right.

1018
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,685
Yeah. So you're just hoping to
be able to get the design up

1019
00:43:51,685 --> 00:43:53,450
to be so reliable, hopefully

1020
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,925
that Yeah, you just don't need a service

1021
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:55,925
- Result.

1022
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:56,758
You need to change the part, you need to

1023
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:57,470
literally cut it open.

1024
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,480
- Wow. So you'll probably,
at this point you might

1025
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,620
as well just like swap out the whole

1026
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,090
engine, I assume and just ah,

1027
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,530
- No, we cut it open. Yeah,

1028
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,140
- Yeah,
- We got it open.

1029
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:12,220
- Alright. It's just crazy. Yeah.

1030
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,070
- I mean there's a massive,
massive bolted flange

1031
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,500
for the hot gas manifold that's
transferring hot gas from

1032
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,700
the .

1033
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,490
Hot, hot from the fuel pump
side. Yeah. You can see that

1034
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,500
- Three,
- It's, it's, well it's hard to point at

1035
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,515
'cause it's up in the air, but the thing

1036
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:32,165
that joins the, the, the, the

1037
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,133
- Fuel the ox. Yeah. The fuel to

1038
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:35,550
- Pump to the ox
- To pump, yeah.

1039
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,935
The kind of band looking thing.

1040
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:40,920
- Right. Yeah. The band
looking thing that, that's a,

1041
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,950
that has a, a mon, a monster
flange at the top and bottom.

1042
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,930
Mm. And you want to get rid of those two

1043
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,880
- And that has to hold a lot of pressure.

1044
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,130
- Hot. That's a whole lot of
pressure. Lot of pressure. Yes.

1045
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,610
- Geez.
- I mean you can see

1046
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,380
there's a lot of flanges here.

1047
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,300
I mean this valve is like, well
this, this pump is like made

1048
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,165
of flanges Wow.

1049
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:03,600
Flange, flange flange, flange flange

1050
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,865
- And are, and like,
- I mean these are

1051
00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:06,330
beast beast level flanges

1052
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,910
- And these are all there.

1053
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,810
So there is no like, active
cooling inside of two like this

1054
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,030
or the current version of
Raptor like this. There's no

1055
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,030
- Current version.

1056
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,560
Does not have, there's,
there's no, there's no, well

1057
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,625
there technically is some,

1058
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,540
but there's not, the current version

1059
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,510
of raptor does not have
sufficient cooling to be able to

1060
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,430
resist being in the, in hot gas plasma.

1061
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,525
Hot plasma. Yeah. It's not, yeah, it

1062
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:36,525
- Would melt.

1063
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,775
That's why I need, that's still
why I need the shield here

1064
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:38,775
- Then.

1065
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:40,470
Yeah. That's why it's,
it's heavily shielded.

1066
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,800
But next gen, a bunch

1067
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,930
of the flanges you see here will disappear

1068
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,250
and it will have integral cooling

1069
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,040
and integral secondary flow circuits.

1070
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
Yeah.

1071
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,666
- Yeah. Do you guys look,
is it possible to do a,

1072
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,920
- There's a whole bunch of engines down

1073
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,600
there pretty densely packed.

1074
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:01,380
It's a lot of thrust.

1075
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,140
- It's a lot of thrust. It is crazy.

1076
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,630
It looks like a, when you go
to a Christmas street store

1077
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,020
or something just, yeah, that's insane.

1078
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,950
- Each one of these is the most

1079
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,720
advanced rocket engine ever made

1080
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,600
- And they're just being
cranked out like it's nothing.

1081
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,260
- Yeah. Super high pressure, high

1082
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,090
efficiency you've got a full flow stage.

1083
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,880
Combustion all the good.
It's insane. Yeah.

1084
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,370
- Is there, is there ever been
any look into, like, I know,

1085
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,820
you know, with aircraft
turbines you can do, you know,

1086
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,250
like some kind of cooling on
the actual turbine blades.

1087
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,140
Is there any way to do any kind

1088
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,300
of cooling on the turbine blades and,

1089
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,760
- And Raptor, we've, we've had
that discussion many times.

1090
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,110
We probably head back into the,

1091
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,720
and see the main factory.

1092
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,520
- Geez. I just can't believe
how much has changed out here.

1093
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,780
You have two mega bays.

1094
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,845
I mean, last time I was out
here there was only one mega bay

1095
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:11,975
and it's neither nothing had doors.

1096
00:47:11,975 --> 00:47:14,940
Now you have doors.

1097
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,280
That's a pretty good creature comfort.

1098
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,990
It is turning into a real
factory, you know, it's, yeah.

1099
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,540
Well this is a real factor
that we're building here. Yeah.

1100
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,610
- So
- Quite big.

1101
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,400
It's hard to keep up
with everything out here.

1102
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,380
- Yeah. So this is a, we'll
finally have a real factory

1103
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,410
for Starship, not just making it in tents.

1104
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,615
Yeah. So long term we
wanna try to get the thrust

1105
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:49,960
of Raptor up to around
330, maybe a little higher,

1106
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,660
maybe 335 metric tons.

1107
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,690
So that'll take us to a 10,000
ton thrust at lift off.

1108
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,145
- That's absolutely absurd.
Sorry. That's absurd. Yeah.

1109
00:48:00,145 --> 00:48:02,110
Yeah. It's absurd. Like beyond absurd.

1110
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,400
That's coming up on three times the

1111
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,690
amount of powers of Saturn V.

1112
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,310
- That's, yeah, that'd
be roughly three times.

1113
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,760
So Saturn five. Yeah,

1114
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,593
- That's what you need. Like

1115
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:11,500
- 22 million pounds

1116
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,690
of thrust Saturn five
is seven and a half. Oh

1117
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,690
- My gosh.

1118
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,560
- So
- Absolutely insane.

1119
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,490
Well, and I think, you know,
there's this kind of feeling of

1120
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,170
why aren't we, aren't people
doing things like the,

1121
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,910
you know, the Saturn V being built in

1122
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,080
the, you know, in the

1123
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,540
- Sixties, Saturn V is
primitive compared to Starship.

1124
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,560
- Yes. And it's insanely
expensive. It wasn't sustainable.

1125
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,660
- Yeah. And it was, it was expendable.

1126
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,310
So yeah, Starship is in a,

1127
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,340
I mean, just any rocket
that is fully reusable,

1128
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,950
which no one has achieved because
it is extremely difficult.

1129
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,860
Not because they didn't think about

1130
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,750
- Reusability. Right. Right.

1131
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,330
- So it was just too hard.

1132
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,660
So, and obviously we haven't
achieved that either.

1133
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,030
You know, we, we've gotta,
I'm hopeful that we'll achieve

1134
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,320
achieve it by next year.

1135
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,895
So, but at least, at
least we have a situation

1136
00:49:11,895 --> 00:49:13,120
where we have a design

1137
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,920
where success is one of
the possible outcomes.

1138
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,100
Yeah. So no, no prior design

1139
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,440
where success is one of the possible

1140
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,550
outcomes for full reusability.

1141
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,340
- Well, and if you think
about it, let's say you guys

1142
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,620
for some reason just were
like, okay, screw it.

1143
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,110
We have to launch 300
metric tons to orbit.

1144
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,510
You could absolutely, you could.

1145
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,980
You could expend a rocket if you like.

1146
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,605
Absolutely had to for some reason. Yeah.

1147
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:40,240
- It be pointless.
- It would be pointless.

1148
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,030
But like you have that capability
like for the first time.

1149
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,530
Oh yeah. Since this added five.

1150
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:48,010
- Well, I mean generally if
you can do 200 tons reusable,

1151
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,920
you can do double that expendable. Right.

1152
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,800
- 400 tons. Yeah. Yeah.
Which is insane. Yeah.

1153
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,380
I mean, even to the point
of if you had to do,

1154
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,240
let's say you had to do, you know, HLS

1155
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,190
or something to try to
speed it up or something

1156
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,010
and you know, if orbital
refuelings not done or something,

1157
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:05,800
- No orbital re refilling, I
mean, I don't wanna count check

1158
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,935
before they hatch, but, or
orbital re refilling is really

1159
00:50:07,935 --> 00:50:09,250
just docking with ourselves.

1160
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,650
Yeah. We dock with the space
station all the time. Right.

1161
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,320
A space station is way harder
to dock with than ourselves.

1162
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,400
- And but will it be all docking
up to a, to like a depot?

1163
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,710
Is that kinda the plan?
Is there to be an orbital?

1164
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,710
It depends on how

1165
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,280
- Quickly you wanna launch.

1166
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,550
So if you, if you're gonna
the moon, I don't know.

1167
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,350
I don't think you need a de depot.

1168
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,090
I think you just send a ship up

1169
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,590
and send tankers immediately.

1170
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,080
Yeah. And your boil off rate
will not be too bad. Okay.

1171
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,640
So you now for the moon,
you'd want to have a dedicated

1172
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,360
earth orbit to moon system

1173
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,710
because you don't need a heat shield.

1174
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,470
Right. Well I need a heat
shield to brake I suppose.

1175
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,320
Well, prob probably actually. Yeah.

1176
00:50:52,865 --> 00:50:54,650
The, the moon's like harder than it seems

1177
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,910
because it doesn't have an atmosphere.

1178
00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:00,020
Right. So you can't use the
atmosphere to brake. So,

1179
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,430
- But if you have time
- You can, I guess you probably

1180
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,600
have anyway.

1181
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,130
It's like yeah, for landing on the moon,

1182
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,445
obviously you don't need
flaps, don't need heat shield

1183
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,150
and you need very little thrust.

1184
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,890
Right. But you do need

1185
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,570
pretty big landing legs.

1186
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,510
So in case you one leg lands on a boulder

1187
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,340
and one lands on a crater.

1188
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,720
Absolutely. And you don't wanna tip over.

1189
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,100
- Right. So

1190
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,930
Because that's a, you know, I
think HLS, I don't think a lot

1191
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,410
of people understand that
we're going from a 16 tonne lunar

1192
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,715
lander with the Apollo
program to a, you know,

1193
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:44,420
I mean I don't even know how heavy HLS is

1194
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,560
gonna be when it, when it lands.

1195
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,255
It's gonna be at, you know,
at least 10 times that massive

1196
00:51:49,195 --> 00:51:51,705
and or wait Yeah.

1197
00:51:51,705 --> 00:51:53,690
At least 10 times that massive

1198
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,630
and acres of volume compared to anything

1199
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,760
that was landed during the Apollo program.

1200
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,160
And I just think that people
aren't necessarily ready for

1201
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,830
how, how big Starship will be on the moon.

1202
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,710
It's basically a habitat when
it's on the moon, you know,

1203
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,840
it's not just a little tiny
tent like the Apollo lunar landers.

1204
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Yeah.

1205
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,630
- Yeah. I mean I think
the, the next step is to go

1206
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,980
beyond Apollo and have a permanently

1207
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,600
occupied base on the moon.

1208
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,820
Yeah. Like Moon base alpha,
that's the next step.

1209
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,080
So you don't wanna just
have a few people there

1210
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,100
for a few hours who wanna have
a permanently occupied base.

1211
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,930
Right.

1212
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,970
- This factory's huge. Yeah.

1213
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:39,650
This, and I guarantee we
came back in a year, it'd be

1214
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,250
just up and running like
a normal factory already.

1215
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,080
- I mean it'll be, this will be filled

1216
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,150
with equipment in three months.

1217
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,270
- Geez. So is there a decent
amount of like, new stuff

1218
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,460
that's like, is there
hardware coming in here

1219
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,770
and tools that are coming here
that will unlock like Yeah,

1220
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,790
just mostly production rate
or even like new ideas or,

1221
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:59,990
or what's that kinda like?

1222
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,280
- I mean, you can build any
given design in an artisanal way

1223
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:09,770
slowly with, you know, by having
a lot, a lot of crews come

1224
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,160
to the same station, but in
order to have real production,

1225
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,160
you've gotta move from one
station to another where

1226
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,440
you have the same amount
of work at each station.

1227
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,790
Right. So this is meant
to have a lot of stations.

1228
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,775
So you'll see a lot of work in Yeah.

1229
00:53:25,775 --> 00:53:28,530
And you'll be able to
see very clearly, I guess

1230
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,330
where the, where the blockages are

1231
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,940
- And make changes to it then.

1232
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,560
Yeah.

1233
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,650
- Geez.
- It's so funny to think about how, I

1234
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,450
know we were only five years
ago out here when the MK1

1235
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,580
and all you had was a tent

1236
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,350
and Stargate was the
biggest thing out here.

1237
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,000
That little Stargate thing. Yeah.

1238
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,740
And now you, I almost missed it trying

1239
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,185
to pull into Stargate today 'cause

1240
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:55,530
- It looks like a little hut.

1241
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,000
- Yeah. It's like dwarfed

1242
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,980
by absolutely everything
else out here already.

1243
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,730
Yeah. It's just crazy.
Oh, that feels nice.

1244
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,550
- Air conditioning.
- Holy crap. It just keeps going. Yeah.

1245
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,810
I thought that was the main thing.

1246
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,620
- Yeah. Geez. It was more
behind that wall. Yeah.

1247
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,900
- Holy crap.

1248
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,430
So this is more of a, a real factory here.

1249
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:21,510
This is what the other side will

1250
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:22,510
- Look like.

1251
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,343
Yeah. The other side will look like this.

1252
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,790
You know, there were, we're
obviously just checking each

1253
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:30,600
tile to make sure it's not
cracked and it's well seated.

1254
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:32,945
- How are you feeling about the,

1255
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:34,295
the way they're actually secured on there?

1256
00:54:34,295 --> 00:54:35,550
Like the, the mounting point? Is that

1257
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,420
- Decent?

1258
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,640
We're continuing to iterate
on the mounting point.

1259
00:54:40,995 --> 00:54:44,040
- I always, I
- Mean it's, it has a, you know,

1260
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,420
99% of the time it works well.

1261
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,230
So it's just a question of
figuring out what are the 1% that

1262
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,575
have issues with cause
cause the tile to crack

1263
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:53,490
or some other problem.

1264
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,590
- I always keep thinking the,
the one of the big challenges

1265
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,080
that you can't access the,
you can only access it.

1266
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,490
You can't access it
from either side really.

1267
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,650
Like there's not a bolt you can screw on

1268
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:02,855
because you have, it's a snap-on.

1269
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:04,455
It's a, it has to be a snap-on. Yeah.

1270
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:06,270
Have you ever seen the
like furniture mountings

1271
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,180
where like you have two
pieces of wood joined together

1272
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,610
and then you spin a magnet on one end?

1273
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,530
Oh yeah. And it spins the nut on.

1274
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:16,650
I've always wondered like if
something like that could be,

1275
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,080
- I mean this is basically, it snaps on

1276
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,590
and you pretty much have to
break the tile to pull it off.

1277
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:27,270
- Really? Yeah.
- Huh. That's meant to go on and stay on.

1278
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,600
- Yeah. And we still see,
like even on the, the parts

1279
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,730
that aren't tapered up, you
know, like on the main's body,

1280
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,400
we still see some, some horizontal seams.

1281
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,800
What's the, what's the
deal with those seams?

1282
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,500
I know that was like pretty bad.

1283
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,370
- No, they, they don't
really matter that much.

1284
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,770
They're just different
sections of the nose cone.

1285
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,990
So now

1286
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,190
this is somewhat of a debate.

1287
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,920
You could wait until the whole
nose cone is made and then,

1288
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,875
and then put the attachment
points on at that point.

1289
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:02,280
So currently we put the tile attachment

1290
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,750
points on in sections.

1291
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,930
Okay. So that's why you've got a line, the

1292
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,930
- Horizontal line.

1293
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,080
Okay. Yeah. It's probably
just a lot harder to,

1294
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,180
once it's all manufactured,
it's so massive it'd be hard

1295
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,770
to put all the attachment points on.

1296
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,590
Is that kind of the problem

1297
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:17,590
- There?

1298
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,630
There's more one way to skin a cat.

1299
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,910
This is just a cat getting skinned. Yeah,

1300
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:21,910
- Yeah.

1301
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,743
- Yeah. It's not, it's not to say

1302
00:56:22,743 --> 00:56:26,535
that there is not a better way to do it.

1303
00:56:26,535 --> 00:56:27,910
Yeah. There are.

1304
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,800
The first order of business is

1305
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,330
to get one way at all That works.

1306
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,120
Yep. Thereafter to optimize. Yep.

1307
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,813
- Hmm.

1308
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:47,085
- Watch your step here.
- There's still a lot

1309
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:48,160
of work that we gotta do here.

1310
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,950
- Oh, that's cool looking.

1311
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,765
That's, is that the, the
landing tank for Yeah,

1312
00:56:53,765 --> 00:56:54,765
- It's the header tank.

1313
00:56:54,765 --> 00:56:58,090
- Header tank there. That's insane.

1314
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,560
Geez. And then are those COPVs propped

1315
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,390
up against it like that then?

1316
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,520
Is that what those Yeah. Geez.

1317
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,915
- Gotta pressurize the head attack with

1318
00:57:09,915 --> 00:57:11,200
something when the engine's not on.

1319
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,690
- Exactly. Wow.

1320
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,565
So the, like the Pez door
that we see on Starship now is

1321
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:34,390
that, do you think
that's gonna stick around

1322
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,620
or is there still gonna be like a

1323
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,450
chomp or someday? Or is it

1324
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,300
- Well, for the Starlink satellites,

1325
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,890
they're pretty flat. So

1326
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,910
- The chomper makes sense.

1327
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,310
- There's no point in having
a giant fairing for a,

1328
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,950
you know, flat little,
it's a giant flat pancake.

1329
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:49,570
Right.

1330
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,870
- What did the, the door test
go reasonably well on the last

1331
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,430
one, or, because I think
you guys aren't doing

1332
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,660
anything with it had some issues.

1333
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,920
Yeah. It's pretty rudimentary
of course, I assume.

1334
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,295
- Yeah. But it's, well
that you've got this sort

1335
00:58:02,295 --> 00:58:06,130
of really quite sophisticated
factory on a sandbar.

1336
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:09,220
On a sandbar by the
Rio Grande. Yeah. Yeah.

1337
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,270
It's like an alien
spaceship landed. Right.

1338
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:17,655
- Seriously. So these are,
are these thrusters here then?

1339
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:18,670
Yeah. Is that what these are

1340
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,880
- Little, little old jet packs.

1341
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,920
This will take the detailed stuff of the,

1342
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,490
that might run a foul and ITAR stuff

1343
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:28,490
- Deal.

1344
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:31,630
- Yeah. I mean, I don't know if,

1345
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:34,900
if anyone is gonna copy us, that would be,

1346
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,010
that's a hard thing to copy.

1347
00:58:46,905 --> 00:58:49,130
- It's come a long way since three tents.

1348
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,080
Yeah, it sure has. I mean,
everything's clean in this.

1349
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,760
There's no mud and dust. It's better when

1350
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,110
- It's has doors on it.

1351
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,110
Yeah.

1352
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,760
- I mean, everything used
to have mud and dust. Yes.

1353
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,650
And birds and things.

1354
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,365
- There's only some finite mud and dust,

1355
00:59:04,365 --> 00:59:05,470
but it's much smaller

1356
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,225
- Than, it's a long ways from
- MK1.

1357
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,745
Yeah. Yeah.

1358
00:59:12,745 --> 00:59:13,870
I mean the MK1 thing,

1359
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,210
it looked like the junk yard at Tatooine

1360
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,680
- Which was charming.

1361
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,200
Yeah.

1362
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,955
- It was a lot of dust
and mud. Farside rocket.

1363
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,245
- Yeah.
- The bar, the farside rocket.

1364
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,280
I mean, MK1 was conceptual
as a concept piece. Yeah.

1365
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,330
Concept, I'd say concept art. It was

1366
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,380
- Part of the journey.

1367
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,420
Absolutely. Yeah.

1368
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,310
So James pointed out that the,

1369
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:39,860
this actually wraps
all the way around the,

1370
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,515
like all of that's still back there.

1371
00:59:41,515 --> 00:59:44,245
There's more to it.
Yeah. That's coming down.

1372
00:59:44,245 --> 00:59:47,005
That's the dome line.
Jeez. That's the dome line.

1373
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:48,355
Dome line and the coils.

1374
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:51,620
That's the starting line's
over there. That's crazy.

1375
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,450
- Yeah. So we do have an
existing factory that's wrapped

1376
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,820
around the one you just saw.

1377
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,235
So that's, that's where we make the,

1378
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:59,420
the ship and the booster. So then

1379
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,340
- That will open up and you'll start Yeah.

1380
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,350
Serpentining it basically through there.

1381
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,600
- Yeah. Look that we'll
take down that wall there.

1382
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,600
That is, once we have the
doors on the other side,

1383
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,580
we will take down that wall

1384
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,200
and then you'll just have factory.

1385
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,480
We'll just kind of go as
far as the eye can see.

1386
01:00:15,995 --> 01:00:18,110
- It's so much bigger than
I thought from the road.

1387
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,190
I mean, it looks big from the road,

1388
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,710
but it's insane. Yeah, it's

1389
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,710
- Ridiculous.

1390
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,585
And obviously the, the, the
sections get gradually bigger

1391
01:00:25,585 --> 01:00:28,130
as, as you go south, right?

1392
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,170
So that's why things
start off sort of short

1393
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,540
and then get taller as you go along

1394
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,540
- Even.

1395
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,820
Yeah. Even the roof line does that, right?

1396
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,260
- Yeah. It's gonna get bigger
if the pieces get bigger.

1397
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,960
- That's absolutely crazy.

1398
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,830
Are you guys still using,
like, I, I remember, you know,

1399
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:44,090
back in the day there's a lot

1400
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,380
of like Tesla motors being used.

1401
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,240
Oh, ac actually you said that
way it out that way. Okay.

1402
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,630
So there's a lot of Tesla motors
being used, like, you know,

1403
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,640
to, for the fins and all that kinda stuff.

1404
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,890
And maybe even the grid
fins had like literally a

1405
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,720
Model S motor or something.

1406
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,570
Are you still kind of using
some Tesla parts like that?

1407
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,980
- Yeah, we just use the Tesla drive units

1408
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,320
to actuate the grid fins

1409
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,705
- And, and the big flaps still too.

1410
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,705
The on ship.

1411
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,630
- Yes. Sorry. Two. Yes. Essentially.

1412
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:18,860
Sorry, I was just thinking
about something else.

1413
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,190
Yeah, the, the, the

1414
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,023
- Hey,

1415
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,590
- The, yeah.

1416
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:31,850
We use the, we're we're
trying not to use hydraulics.

1417
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,220
We're trying, it's all
electric actuation. Yeah.

1418
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,200
So the engine is

1419
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,670
also gambled electrically.

1420
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,350
- Yep. So you're really moving away from

1421
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,360
hydraulics wherever, possibly. Really?

1422
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,710
- Yeah. There's almost,

1423
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,600
I think there's actually no
hydraulics in the vehicle.

1424
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,590
I, if there's hydraulics
some very tiny little part,

1425
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,540
huh. But I think there's none.

1426
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,240
- That's wild. Actually. I
can't even think of another.

1427
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,920
- Yeah, there's pneumatics,
- Right?

1428
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,020
A lot for all the valves and
everything obviously. Yeah.

1429
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,300
That's crazy.

1430
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:10,340
- Geez.
- It's surreal compared to what it was.

1431
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:15,260
Yeah, it was surreal just
a little bit ago. Wow.

1432
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,510
It just keeps going and going. That is

1433
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:19,510
- Crazy.

1434
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:25,035
Yeah. From one little tent. Yeah.

1435
01:02:25,035 --> 01:02:26,375
- This is starting to make Hawthorne look

1436
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,660
tiny. And Hawthorne's a,

1437
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,540
- A big, well, Hawthorne's
actually a whole campus.

1438
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:35,370
Cool. Absolutely crazy.

1439
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,080
- That's Meme Street.
- Meme Street? - yeah.

1440
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,270
Is that, is that what it says now?

1441
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:44,490
- That's what, that's what it's called.

1442
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,840
- All right. I think we're
jumping in a different car here.

1443
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,750
- But if you look at the street sign

1444
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,430
- We got Meme Street. Yeah. It's

1445
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:54,630
- Literally called Meme Street.

1446
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,960
It's, that is its official
name. It used to be called Wemes.

1447
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,220
And we changed it from Wemes to Memes.

1448
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,320
- The important things.
I love it. Holy crap.

1449
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,390
Was that incredible or what?

1450
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,575
Huge Thank you to especially
Elon Musk for showing us around

1451
01:03:09,575 --> 01:03:11,100
and, and following up and,

1452
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,475
and just teaching us so
much about what's going on

1453
01:03:13,475 --> 01:03:15,090
and, and showing us the inside.

1454
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,530
